56,"Hi Jonathan, I have heard you are writing some thorough reports for the Beta project! We are happy to have someone with so much attention to detail working on this project. I know you aspire to be a lead engineer in the next year, so I want to provide you with a couple coaching tips that will help you achieve your goals:  Technical reports should only include facts. Your opinions are valued and I am happy that you are so eager to share your thoughts. Remember, though, the audience reading your technical reports are only concerned with the facts. Information must be presented in a concise, organized manner. Spending some extra time to organize your reports in a clear, easy to follow, manner will benefit the customers reading them. I am going send you a few examples of reports I have written that emphasize these two points. Keep these tips and the examples I send you in mind while writing your next report. I am happy to review your next report with you if you want more advice. Implementing these tips in your reports will improve your writing style and help you take the next jump to lead engineer. Keep up the good work, Jonathan. Thanks, William"
152,"Jonathan, I'm reaching out regarding the reports you are currently working on and am wanting to emphasize the need for brevity when presenting to our customers and CEO. The reports you are currently providing are thorough, insightful, and informative. The value from your work on these reports can not be overstated. However, our customers and CEO get lost in the details and risk missing the forest for the trees. I'm aware of your ambitions for a lead engineer promotion.  It's a critical that position keep things simple when working with our customers and CEO. So do this for me: Because the reports you are providing have such valuable insight, prepare them as you normally do in a draft format. Then go back over in review and slim it down and send to Terry. He'll be able to work with you to slim the report down further until it is what we are looking for.  He can also provide some good pointers w/regards to business writing that you should incorporate. Don't disregard the ideas and content that you have been including in the reports. Simply retain them for when you have an opportunity to get in front of the clients. Give them enough to come back to us with more questions and keep them on the hook. Please be sure to cc' me on the next report you send to Terry. I'll try to find some time to provide my own feedback as well. Best regards and keep up the good work, William"
101,"Hi Jonathan, I understand that you are helping with regards to the Beta project by creating Technical reports. I have received information that while your technical reports are insightful, they are not concise enough. This naturally is a worry since others that depend on your reports need extra time to decipher, process and utilize the information needed. I request that you please succinctly explain the issues in your reports and provide a short report summary towards the end. I am sure that this type of business writing improvement will help you progress your career since this is a critical skill to develop towards your promotion. I would like to request that you approach HR and find out whether there are possibilities to participate in a ""business writing"" course. I think this would help you improve your skills. Finally, we value all your inputs and request that you consider this feedback constructively. If you have any questions, please feel free to schedule a call with me. Thanks & Regards William"
25,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're well and the road is treating you well.I've received really positive feedback from Terry, he's been really impressed with your work ethic and he also mentioned you're coming up with improvement recommendation yourself!! Impressive!!I do however need you help with the way we're collecting the data, as you know these reports are being shared with the CEO and are also customer facing. So we must ensure that when these reports are submitted they should only include the facts and if you have some personal views, you can still share them but not in these reports. You will have to share your opinions separately, as we do value your input, but cannot include them in the reports. We also need to work on your layout when putting these reports together to ensure that they are easy to read and the reader gets all the information you are providing. I understand this isnt human nature to a lot of people and its just something we need to support you with, so going forward you need to have either myself (if I'm around) or someone else review them to ensure the reports reflects the best possible outcome for you and the business. I'm keen to see you succeed and this will be valuable development for you as an individual, especially one day if you were interested in stepping up to a lead engineer position once one became available, this is the sort of development and support you could pass on to junior engineers.Let me know if this makes sense and if you have any concerns. Cheers William "
102,"Hi Jonathan. Thank you for taking time out to meet with me. I want to start off by saying Thank you for assisting with the Beta project. You are a great contributor and very personable. You are innovative in a way that you identify improvements we didn't know we needed! Jonathan, with strengths, there also comes opportunitesto improve. Jonathan, I need for you to work on the structure and presentation of your reports.I appreciate all of your ideas and insights, but in your reports, there's often personal opinions mixed in with technical information, which essentially causes added work of editing. What I need from you is to become more concise. Also, how you structure your report is just as important as the content. I need for you to make sure that it is organized and clear for our editors to read. Some ways you can improve include rereading the reports aloud before sending them in or asking your peers for advice until you feel 100% confident. You expressed your concerns with collecting so much information. I would love to help you condense all of your learnings and structure your reports to where all of your topics are clearly outlined. I will give you an example of the type of format that I am looking for, that way you will be able to clearly see the expectations. Jonathan, I need your commitment of improvement by your nextreport. If you need any help before submitting, be sure to collaborate with your peers, as I will be on a special assignment after today. I know you are interested in growing with the company, so I hope you channel this feedback and capitalize this opportunity to improve.  I am happy that we got a chance to sit down. Is there anything that I can assist with to help you succeed? Your love for learning and developingwill continue to help you succeed with the Beta project. "
33,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing well. I got a day here and decided on connect with you on the Beta project.I heard good things about the information you have been providing on the project and how helpful it has been. Looks like you are enjoying the work and are enthusiastic about it. What is equally important is to ensure that others are equally excited about your work too. I have received feedback that your reports are turning too verbose and you need improvement on your report writing skills.Jonathan.. All your hard work will go underappreciated if you are not able to put it to an efficient output that others can quickly understand and appreciate.Here are some suggestions for you:Review and edit your final product: You may want to put everything you think is important in your first draft. But once you're done, do multiple reviews and question yourself on each segment, if it is really important, can this be concise, is this repetitive. With each review, your reports will definitely improve.Stick to technical facts: While I understand the urge to provide explanations and inferences so you can provide a detailed picture. You can structure it differently. Create a main concise section with only the important points, which should be the final report. You can add additional reference section with the details for anyone who needs more information.  This will allow people who do not have the time to read the detailed reports to also get the gist.Enroll for Business Writing training program:  Get in touch with HR to help you find a suitable program. Improving these skills will help  you in long term.You are a hard working ambitious guy, and with your aspiration to be a lead engineer, it is important that you are deliverable are high quality and appreciated by team and customers.Do send a copy of your current report and the one you will create after incorporating these suggestions. This will help you put a timeline and get an outside perspective. I will review and give me feedback for further development, once I am back Good Luck!"
7,"Jonathan, I was hoping to be able to chat with you in person about your work on the Beta project.  First of all I love the passion you put into your work and it seems as if you are really enjoying your experiences and learning new things.  I had an opportunity to review some of your reports and I wanted to offer some feedback.  When writing your reports, let's leave factual information in the reports and separate your opinions from the facts, this will allow your peers and others to decipher the information require quickly and clearly.  Please make sure your reports are structured and organized.  I would suggest outlining all the pertinent information at the top of your reports and adding in any comments you would like to add towards the bottom.  I would suggest reaching out to your peers for suggestions and idea on how to structure the reports to make them simple and professional to present to managers, a lot of your peers have good experience in this area.   Please send your next report to me to review before submitted, I'd like an opportunity to review your improvements and offer some feedback.  If there is anything I could do to better support you please let me know.  You're doing great and keep that passion going, really important to the business and we can feel the energy in the reports. Thanks"
167,"Dear Jonathan, I'm writing to you to share the feedback I have received on your recent reports on the Beta project. I understand that you have been putting in a lot of effort in traveling and gathering very good technical information. I'm glad that you are excited about this project and want to share all the information that you have collected. Considering that this project has very technical requirements, and the persons receiving the reports need it in time to decide on the follow up actions, we need clear and concise reports. In view of this, I would appreciate if your trim your reports and focus on the technical aspects of your findings. I know this is a relatively new experience for you, and as such, we could organize a quick technical writing training or you when you are back in the office. Let me know how I can help, if anything is not clear. Regards, William"
98,"Hi Jonathan, How are you recently? I heard that you have been working with Terry recently on the Beta project and have been busy traveling to gathering information for your technical reports. I have also read some of the reports that you have submitted, and I'm surprised how much information you can gather within such short periods of time and there also some good suggestions to help the team improve! However, sometimes too much information might be overwhelming for the reader as well. Here are some suggestions that can consider when writing your next report. Try to summarize your report and focus on technical information first. You can separately draft your opinions and recommendations in another report to be submitted to Terry. Your reports also have to be reviewed by other team members, so do take note on the timeline and give sufficient time to the rest so that we can achieve the timeline as a team. I have also attached some great technical reports here, hope they would help with your upcoming technical reports and Terry would also be able to provide further training if necessary. I'm very happy to see your enthusiasm to the Beta project and the Company, keep it up! As always, I'm available for any discussions if you need. Warmest Regards!"
157,"Hi Jonathan, How are you doing  lately? The Beta project must be keeping you really busy with the travelling and compiling of the reports. I heard some really good feedback from the team. You have been a good contributor, and you have identified improvements that the tea didn't even realise that they need. Keep up the good work! I also sense that you are really excited about this project and is looking forward to leveraging this project to gain a promotion to lead engineer. In order for your reports to add value to the project and the teams, I would like to highlight these areas of improvement: Clear and concise report. For reports to be easily and quickly understood, it has to be concise and contain only technical information. We noticed that the reports that you submitted consists of both information and opinions. This results in a much longer report than required. Organisation of the report. Organise the report in a logical and structured manner will help your readers understand what you are trying to say. Consider the amount of details in the report, so that the information that you present is meaningful to the reader.With this in mind, how can you change your reporting layout/structure to make it better for our audiences? At the same time, are there any support or resources that you need from Beata or myself to help you with writing better reports? To be a lead engineer, we will need better business writing skills, on top of the awesome skills that you already have. Let me know your thoughts around this, and I am happy to discuss.  Cheers! William"
94,"Hello Jonathan - It’s great to so you have such enthusiasm for the technology that you are working with, but there is a few issues that need to be taken care of concerning your reports. The reports need to based based in facts only. Although your opinions are important, a technical report is not the place for them. We also need to work on the layout and organization. They should be easy to follow. I realize that this is the first time that you have had a position where these reports are required. I would like you to take the time to review some other technical documents to get a better feel on how yours should be layed out. I can provide you with some if you would like so you can use them as a kind of template.If you have any issues, please let me know, and we can work on this."
89,"Hello Jonathan, How are you? I know that you are traveling and hence figured that writing to you would be the best way to reach you. I have received very good feedback about your contributions to the Beta project. Congratulations!Jonathan, along with all the good things I heard about you, there is a concern that has come up. This is regarding the reports that you have been submitting. Your reports seem to have too many details and are poorly organized. I understand that you try to share your insights on the Beta project through these reports. However, it would really bring out your best work if you keep your reports restricted to only the technical information and more concise. Would you like some help to hone your business writing skills? If yes, please reach out to HR for access to business writing courses or trainings. Do set up some time with Terry for him to take you through some reports he has drafted. I would also recommend you to read some of your reports that Terry has edited before sending to our prospective customers or ABC-5's CEO. I'm sure you understand that as important as it is to do a good job, it is also important to be able to draft reports that help others get to the most important facts quickly and in the best way possible.  Here is another idea. Would you consider having verbal discussions or virtual meetings with the team to share the information that you consider really valuable to the team? I am sure the team would love to learn from the unique insights and perspectives that you have on the Beta project. Let me know what you think. In case you need any support from me or if there is any way I can help you with this, please do let me know. I really appreciate all the hard work that you have put in for this project. Do keep up your enthusiasm and I hope to hear a lot more great feedback about you when I come back.Good luck! Regards, William.  "
5,"Dear Jonathan, Came to know about the good work you are doing on the Beta project. It seems great to work with dedicated and passionate colleagues like you. The purpose of this communicate is mainly to apprise you on some improvement areas which if you will work on will end up saving lot of time for the colleagues working with you on the project. The following two areas are creating some rework for the team members and considering the time pressure it would be appreciated if you could work on them:1: Focus on facts and creating to the point reports: This would ensure that the team will not end up spending time on separating the facts from your personal opinions. 2: Work on your business writing skills: While your detailing is commendable but please ensure that the reports are as per the organisational guidelines and not verbose. This would also end up in saving lot of time of the colleagues working on the project. I am sure that you will work on the above and come back to me with the improvement plan. If you want I can suggest some good training programs on Business Writing to you. Do let me know. Thanks and Best Regards"
106,"Hi Jonathan, just wanted to discuss the reports you've been submitting on the Beta Project whilst travelling. You mention that it has been challenging whilst travelling, and this certainly can be tricky to manage the time. How are you finding this and is there any help I can assist with on this front? I always find that good reports are short, to the point and convey the most important facts about the data. Additional commentary can often make writing these reports longer than they need to be and ultimately we all have time deadlines to meet. The data on these reports are the most important details to gather and report back on. Would I be able to send over some examples of really good reports and quickly run through the best features of these. As you can now attest to, managing our time on these reports isn't always easy but if we can make these more concise then it really helps everyone else in the team and helps you to stand out. I think at the moment and based on some of the reports submitted so far, there is a great potential to benefit from this exercise.Because of the time pressure on this project we will need to keep checking on these and if you need assistance on anything please don't hesitate to ask. Can I get your commitment on this?"
165,"Hi Jonathan, It has recently been brought to my attention that there has been some issues with the reports you have been providing for the Beta Project. I understand that you are very excited about this project and want to provide as much insight as possible, but with this in mind I do believe it is important to that you remain focused on only the technical information that you were asked to provide as your reports influence some critical decisions here at ABC-5. I recommend that for this project you carefully listen to the direction of the project lead and inquire as to what information that they are hoping to see from your reports. If you are interested, we could also review your reports together and explore different approaches to business writing? If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. Thank you."
51,"Jonathan, I am so pleased to hear you are enjoying this project so much and we appreciate all the effort you are putting in to it. I just need to address a few concerns that have been raised in regards to the reports you have generated. What I need from you is to create clear and concise reports. Although we appreciate the extra effort you are putting in it is not required in the report. I'd like to suggest creating a detailed outline before starting to write the report highlighting the required sections that need to be detailed in the report. I personally find this helpful when I need to complete reports so I know that all the information required has been included. I am still on assignment but can make time to review your next report before you submit it if you need some feedback. We could also arrange to have you attend a business writing course to help out if we decide that would be beneficial to you. Please don't hesitate to ask for help or feedback if you are feeling as though you need some clarification. We want you to be successful in your pursuit of being the lead engineer and in order to get there these are changes we need made. Thanks Jonathan. "
148,"Jonathan, Hello it's William. I want to reach out to you and discuss the Beta project you have been working on. I've been getting feed back that you have been a good contributor and that everyone on the team likes you. Good job. I did want to speak to you about your reports though, I have gotten some feed back that your reports can be long and offer a lot of opinions when sometimes it's better to stick to the facts. I have read through some of them myself and have to agree. I would ask you to keep your reports to the facts and organized thoughts throughout. Okay? I know you are still fairly new to the business world so am going to work with you through the next couple of reports to ensure you understand what I'm looking for and after that I'll have you copy me with your reports as well. I know you will do a great job in correcting this as you understand exactly what ABC-5 is looking for. Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with."
8,"Hi Jonathan. How are you recently?I heard that you are involved in the Beta Project and i heard that Terry gave his good commentary on you on your  good contribution and able to identify good improvements points where the team are not able to identify. Well done, i said . Well, along the way, they also have given several suggestions to improve on your works. Thus, i would like to advise you on this.As in the report you sent to the team, we would like you to be objective in the report given which in technical information. Personal opinions is good but it should not including inside the technical report which we going to present to our clients.  Also, when we writing to the clients we should not put too much details inside, it should be generic and understanding to the public.  You can refer to Terry on this report formatting. I know you are doing great and want to get move on. Thus, this several points which just mentioned, you need to improve to work as a team. I will say this suggestions actually helping you to grow and develop higher position in future.I will hope that you are able to demonstrate this and please free to drop me a message if you have read this comments . Sincerely, William"
41,"Jonathan, It has come to my attention that there have been issues with the way in which you are reporting the findings amongst the team. I am aware that business writing is not something you have been formally trained on, so I have booked time for you to take a seminar on it to be completed before your next report is due. I understand that you have a passion for this work, however, we need the report to be technically sound and to keep our own personal opinions out of the equation, by focusing on the facts. I learned to utilize the inverted pyramid style when writing, by placing all the important topics at the top and then further along going into detail. I know that once you complete this course, your work will become concise and it will make you an even better contributor to the team. When you land, please set up a time so we can discuss further. William"
12,"Hi Jonathan, Learnt that you are helping the team with Beta project. Glad that you are identifying new improvements as well. Since you know that for a seamless delivery of any project, we don't only need the technical expertise but also a language that bridges the gap between our and our stakeholders' understanding. Today, I wanted to lay out the significance of the same. At an organizational level, we expect certain standards to be followed for Business writing and communication and we want you too to understand for your career growth with us. We appreciate the reports that we create to contain the facts and not the insights derived from those, as those might cloud the understanding and interpretation.To build up an experience with business writing, I am suggesting HR to offer you a business writing and communication course for 2 weeks along with test cases to hone your writing skills.I am sure you will easily fill this gap and add this skill to your personality in order to grow yourself further with us.HR will reach out to know with more details around this. Let me know for questions, if any. Regards, William"
110,"Hello Jonathan, I hope you are well and enjoying the travel for the Beta project. I would like to take some time to discuss an issue we are having with the technical reports.I have observed on  several reports that the technical reports have:A) facts mixed with opinionsB) reports that are too lengthy, containing too much detailC) the reports are poorly organized in thoughts and structureIt is important that the technical reports are technically fact based, concise, and arranged in a logical structure. This will ensure that the reports are delivered on time (not delayed due to rewriting), easy to read by other high-ranking managers, and that PMS makes the correct critical decisions based on these reports. I know that you have a view to being promoted to lead engineer, where report writing will be critical to your success.  ABC-5 really values the job you are doing in the field and identifying improvements, and if we could just correct this one issue, I am sure this would secure your continued success on this project.So, based on this information and observations that I have provided, what is your view? Do you see it the same way, or is their other details that you would like to share?Assuming that we both agree on the issue, what suggestions would you have to correct these reports? While you are thinking about solutions, here are a few ideas you could consider:perhaps developing a template to follow, to help organize the thoughts and structure in advance?Terry is an experienced report writer, would you feel comfortable asking for some tips and mentoring?What other ideas would you like to explore? I am looking forward to hearing your solutions.By the next technical report, I would like to see an improvement in the complexity and brevity of the report. I will follow up in 2 weeks time to review the solutions that we can agree on.I know you will bring your considerable energy and ability  to solve problems to this one as well! Kind regards, William"
131,"Hi Jonathan, I want to address an issue that was brought up to my attention by Terry. We appreciate your energy and commitment. I know you are excited and want to put everything you experience in the report. But the report at time contains to much information that's not require or make sense to the Beta project. I want you to focus on the Beta project and submit report that everybody on the project can understand. If you like you can email me the report I'll go over it and give you some pointers along the way. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you, William"
133,"Hi Jonathan, I wanted to do a quick check-in on the Beta project. I know this has been a real stretch assignment for you and I can tell by your video you are excited. I wanted to provide you with some additional feedback in order to support your success. I realize that you have not had a lot of experience with technical reports. We should consider some development opportunities in this area. I know Terry is a real expert in this area. i am going to reach out to him and ask him to share some previous reports that you can use as a reference. This will help you make sure you reports are both concise and well-organized. In the meantime I would like you to find additional opportunities to develop these skills. We need to stick to our current set of deliverables to n order to keep the project on track, I need to you focus in on a couple of areas as you wrap up your last report.:Does this report contain technical information only? By sticking to the facts, it will help reduce the length of the report and help make it more concise.Please have a peer review your report before submitting it to Terry. And copy me as well.I know there is a learning curve here, but I really need you to make sure you are adhering to the guidelines so we can keep this project on track. Let me know what additional support you need regarding this deliverables I mentioned."
134,"Hi Jonathan, I hope this communication finds you well. I understand you are traveling but wanted to take the time to address some topics that have been brought to my attention.We really appreciate all the work you have done so far with the Beta project. Your enthusiasm really shows.  I understand you have even identified improvements we didn't know we needed. There have been some work including extra reviews, that has been involved with your reports. These reports should only contain technical information. When there are opinions or other persectives please address them with me, but do not include them in there reports. We appreciate the work and time that goes into writing these reports, but need to maintain what is expected of them. I expect that this will take effect immediately. If no improvement is seen, I may need to look into alternatives for fill this role.In addition, our company has access to many different continuing education courses, many of which can assist employees with different areas of their performance. There is a course on business writing and how to organize reports and information. Please register for this course and have in completed by the end of the month. We can discuss this further when I am back in 2 weeks. This will benefit you in many aspects of your professional career and future opportunities.Please respond and acknowledge receipt of this message and let me know of any other questions you may have. Thank you, William"
38,"Hi Jonathan, I'm hearing great things about you and your contributions to our team. I reviewed some of your reports recently and I can certainly appreciate your level of detail in your reports. You're definitely proving to show promise in an engineering capacity where maximum detail is appreciated. The technical reports you have been submitting are however somewhat overwhelming in the level of detail for the intended audience, and so I'd like to ask if you have thought about a professional writing course at a local community college soon to assist in developing these skills? I'd be happy to cover the tuition fees as a part of your development towards the next step in your career. For now would you be able to scrub some of the technical details from your reports going forward, and send them to me in advance of the rest of the team for some coaching opportunities? Please - keep collecting technical data as you have been, data and detail are paramount to what we're doing here at ABC-5 - particularly in your desired next step to engineering team lead. Let me know what you think and don't forget to send your next report to me directly. Best, William"
11,"Good day Jonathan, Thank you for the positive energy that you bring to the Beta project. It does not go unnoticed. The objective of the message is to discuss the format and content of your report.  I noted that you mentioned that you will be putting together another report this week. We appreciate all your insights on the Beta project, however as you are working towards being promoted to lead engineer, a critical requirement would be to deliver a high quality report.  I would therefore highly encourage you to focus on the following points to deliver a high quality report:Ensure that only facts are highlighted in the reports, although we appreciate al your insights, the report should only state the facts such as technical information. Ensure that the report has a flowI would also suggest that you reach out to HR to find out if there are a business writing course that they would suggest that you can attend to ensure that you utilise this opportunity to deliver a high quality report as it can be to your benefit for the promotion.Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Best regards, William"
166,"Hi Jonathan, Always glad to hear from you. I understand you are really enjoying your work with the Beta project and are excited about the findings and applications.I would firstly, like to tell you that your contributions and ideas about improvements are valued by ABC-5. They just go on to show how deeply you are involved in the whole process which is great. At ABC-5 we strive to continuously improve upon our work and the output we give and as your manager and mentor, there is some feedback that i want to give you so that you can develop and grow at ABC-5. In such high-profile projects like this one, as much as the process of gathering information , going deep into understanding whats happening is important, how the findings are presented especially to the senior leadership is equally important. It is critical that when you submit reports for the project, you clearly distinguish between the facts and what your opinions and insights are. I also want you to take up a course of business writing so that your findings in the reports come out to be more articulate. Your reports influence critical decisions here and I think with overcoming these two areas of development, your growth both personal and professional is bound to happen. Wish you great success in the project, all the best! "
16,"Jonathan, Due to your traveling, we are unable to connect by video.  I am in the office for one day to catch up and resolve issues among our team progress/processes.  I hear you are very excited to be part of the team and working on the Beta Project- this is exactly what ABC-5 looks for- engagement of our members.  I would like to have a discussion regarding feedback on the reports you have submitted.  The expectation of the reports are to be objective in nature and contain only technical information.  From the feedback, the readers find it difficult to separate facts from opinion, lots of unnecessary commentary which prevents the reader from identifying the major points.    I would like to offer you a business writing course offered by ABC-5.  This course assists our employees on how to write a business plan with key elements.Please let me know when you have taken the course.  Until then, I would suggest  having one of your team members review the reports prior to submission.  I know you will be receptive to this suggestion as you are valued on our team. William"
185,"Good Afternoon Jonathan, Terry has brought to my attention some concerns with the reports that he's received from you recently. He has pointed out two areas that require improvement soon as they are causing additional work when finalizing reports. First, he believes that there is too much commentary in your reports. for the sake of deadlines, only include the most pertinent information your reports. His other concern was that your reports are not to the level they should be. They are unorganized and need extra editing before they can be presented to the prospective clients often times making the reports late. I know that this can be a little discouraging since you've expressed interesting in moving up, but we can definitely work together to help you improve. I will have Terry, send me your previous emails so I can go over them and identify the areas where we can help you in improve. Additionally, I will assign you one to revise so you can get a better idea of what info we need in these reports.Please reach out to me if you have any concerns of your own. Best, William"
195,"Hello Jonathan, I hope this email finds you well. I have seen that you have been helping out with the Beta project for some time, and I do appreciate your effort and time that you have been invested into this. However, I do also need your attention on the following points that I think you need to improve to be more efficient with your job flow and more effectively to communicate with your colleagues. I understand the working background where you are coming from which hinders you from communicate within the organization professionally and effectively. However, I do believe that if you can specifically improve the following two things, you will go much further in your career. Try to put less of commentary in your report, because these are opinions not facts, which will create extra problems that are not necessarily healthy in the team problem solving environment.

103,"Hi Jonathan, While I'm out of the office, I'd like to provide some feedback to you regarding the Beta projects and the format of the reports. First, I appreciate your zeal for the work that you are doing. Given that we are under tight deadlines to make some important decisions, the reports that are being provided need to be concise and direct. I understand that there is a lot of information coming in, but the reports need to be filtered to contain only the most important information so that we are providing clear direction to our customers and management team. I have a couple of recommendations for you moving forward:Please review the attached reports as these are excellent examples of the type of communication that has worked well in the past.Prior to submitting the report, please review all information and ensure that you are communicating and prioritizing details before submitting. Bullet points typically work well so that the report can be reviewed quickly.There is a course that may help with best practices on business writing to help with improving these reports. I'd like for you to find some time over the next few weeks to participate.Lastly, if you have any specific questions on how the reports should be  formatted, please reach out. I'm traveling but will be available to provide feedback via email or over the phone. Lets discuss once you have reviewed the reports and taken the course to discuss any additional questions you may have. Thanks, William"
60,"Hi Jonathan, I hope all is well with you.I know you have been working hard to get a promotion and I want to make sure that all your effort is put to good work.We need to meet to discuss the feedback on past reports and expectations on level of reporting. I have noticed that reports are coming in late and require a lot of rework before sending them out to senior management.We have work to do on getting you the support to go through all the data and selecting the relevant information to aid decision making for senior management. At the moment you are taking on all on your own and I believe you will benefit from more direct guidance at the moment. It will help you to focus the time you dedicate to research and the time you dedicate to putting your recommendations together.together we can see what you need, where you are getting stuck or unsure and define a plan with clear goals and expectations to help you reach the expected level. Please, think openly and critically about this and prepare an overview of the points where you think you need support, both as hands but also coaching.I am sure you will get the hand of it in no time and you will be able to bring the quality of your reporting up and get the recognition you want.Looking forward to our meeting and to get this started. Kind regards, William"
66,"Hello Jonathan, First at all I hope you are having a safe trip. The main objective of this mail is to know your opinion about some feedback that I have received from one of your colleagues about your reports of the Beta Project.The main problem is that the words and way to express yourself in the reports are not at a management level, and don't get it wrong, the technical data is in there and helps to the team but also there is too much ""non-important"" information that creates confusion into the reports.The idea is to have a all the good technical data into the reports and go direct to the point and avoid as much as possible write ""trivial"" things that are not adding value. Let's do something, next time you create a report, please send it to me and so I can review it and then I can give you some feed back about this trying to polish your writing, what do you think? Please let me know your comments.Don't feel this mail as an attack but as a way to improve and reach in a near future your desired promotion. Best regards, William"
126,"Hi Jonathan. Thank you for your hard work and enthusiam with this project. Your efforts are appreciated. As you stated in the video, I too want to help prepare your for the next step in your career - and possible promotion. Since we value personal and professional growth in our culture, I want to provide some feedback regarding the reports you write.It has been observed that your reports and be verbose, provide too much commentary - and not always provide the information you provide in a clear manner. I want to help you improve in the writing of the reports - thus better preparing you for the next step in your career. Jonathan, can you do these 3 things for the next 3 reports you write:1) I want the overall length to be 50% shorter than your last report. This will force you to communicate in a more concise and simple manner. 2) I want 2 people on your team to proof read your reports before you submit to the entire group.3) After, steps one and two, email the report to me for final feedback before sending out. I will send back to you within 24 hours.Jonathan, let me know today if this is agreeable to you, and offer any questions. Thank you. I value you - and look forward to helping your prepare for your next role in our organization."
193,"HI Jonathan, I recently received feedback from Terry about the Beta reports you have been submitted to the team. He has shared with me some concerns about the content of the report and I feel the need to address it since the reports you have been submitting are very critical in making decisions from Management regarding the Beta Project. First, I would like you to sit with Terry before the end of this week and get an clear and precise understanding of what the report should and should not include. Second, get Terry's and other team member's sample reports from their trips and study them. I can send you a sample of my most recent report to management as well.Third, send me the report from this weeks activities, I would like to take a look myself. Thank you, Looking forward to your report."
57,"Hello Jonathan, I am writing to you regarding your reports that are being submitted for the Beta project. It's very clear that you have a passion for the role you play and are a very enthusiastic contributor to the team. Although having a great attitude does go a long way I'd like to discuss the concern with regards to your reports themselves.Your personal insights are not required for the types of reports that you submit for the Beta project. Although you may feel as though these insights are valuable they do not allow the team to quickly and easily define trends in the information. It creates a great deal of added effort on the project lead to review and refine the report to prepare it in a way that it can be analyzed.I urge you to bring any added insights to the lead prior to including them in your report to determine if they are beneficial to the information submitted.Terry has an exceptional background in writing business reports and can help support you in your learning and development. Working with our colleagues and teammates to help build our skills and development creates a collaborative and strong team. You can learn a great deal through others skills and personal insights. Please speak with Terry to seek support and guidance on your Business Writing skills and let me know should you require further support or assistance.These opportunities will help with your goal of being promoted and are necessary skills for your future endeavors so I hope that you can see the value in developing these points.I will check in on your progress in two weeks time. Best Regards, William"
189,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you so much for all of the information gathering you are doing in support of the Beta Project. We certainly need as much information as we can and you are doing a great job. I'm hoping I can make just a few suggestions however as you prepare the next report. I certainly appreciate your insights on all that you've collected but I'm hoping that we could refine the reporting a bit The reports need to be prepared in such a way that they can easily be passed along to prospective customers and to our CEO. If we can work to focus just on the main points in our reporting that would be much appreciated. I'd also be happy to work through this report with you so that we are both on the same page moving forward. I have some sample reports I was able to take from some business writing courses that I've used my entire career. I'm also happy if you are interested in taking a course made available through ABC-5 to provide you the time to dedicate to a course that can help you grow in your position. Please let me know how I can help. Best, William"
145,"Hi Jonathan, I am pleased to hear that you are enjoying your role on the Beta Project and have found interesting insights into the use of the technology and have identified some useful improvements. However, I understand that Terry has spoken to you about the content of your reports. Unfortunately, these specific reports need to be more concise and written in a certain format so that the team can quickly understand the issues and that they can be passed on to the CEO or prospective customers.I know that you are keen to perform well but you need to change the way you present these reports, if you want to  gain the respect of your colleagues and impress them with the wealth of knowledge that you have. To help you improve the reports, I will arrange for a template to be sent to you so that you know what is expected and will speak to HR about you attending a business writing course. When I get back we can discuss whether you think this will be helpful. In the meantime, can you think about whether there is anything I or ABC-5 can do to help you as we need to have a plan in place that will help you towards your goal of promotion? Kind regards William"
53,"Hi Jonathan, I hope your travel is going well.I wanted to touch base with you regarding the Beta project and the work you've been doing on it.  I'm hearing a lot of good things regarding your efforts and the reports you have written.  As you know, these reports are often passed on by Terry to prospective customers and/or ABC-5's CEO, it is therefore very important that they be well written, accurate and relatively brief or to the point.Having said that, I would suggest your reports focus primarily on factual, technical information you have identified.  It is important that you keep in mind who will be reading these reports and what this audience is looking to get out of them.  Keeping them brief and to the point would reflect well on your ability to identify the pertinent facts in a timely manner, a key quality that the company looks for in their Lead Engineers.Any commentary you may have should be kept as concise and brief, and placed at the very end of the  report so it will not be confused with the facts.Keeping your reports more concise and brief will reflect well on your abilities.  If you disagree, please let me know.  As well, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.On your next report, please send me a copy.  I'd like to review it and give you any constructive feedback that may help you move up within the company.  What you bring to your role and the Beta Project as a whole, is definitely recognized and appreciated. Best Regards, William"
32,"Hello Jonathan, I hope all is going well in my absence. Though your reports contain a lot of helpful information you need to dial it back to the technical specifics as you have to consider the audience you are generating these reports to being executive level management. The team has been having to review your reports pretty heavily and its consuming a lot of their time so please work with them to narrow down the reports to the pertinent information that is required based on their feedback and make sure to maintain those suggestions on future reports. I personally have struggled with information overload in my career but you have to be able to present the most detail you can in a short amount of space. Please work with Terry to dial in the report to what is pertinent and when I return we can work together to further enhance your reporting. Thanks and keep up the good work."
196,"Hello Jonathan, I had the opportunity to read your report and by the way is very good approach that you had in the technical observations, is very helpfull to consolidate some points for the project. Just one comment that Id like to make is about your explanation and opinion, for this my sugestion is to discuss before with me or the team to understand better your points before add in the report, just to avoid misunderstanding from the team or our customer because for this we have to show the evidences to ensure and have more accurancy about the information.I can see that you have many ideas and good suggestion to improve and help the team in this projects, We have to consider it. Please lets discuss about your ideas, show to the team the benefits and then we can consider the main point suggested by you.Just to support you in the reports and make easy for you, Ill send you the standard report approved in our procedure as we can use. Please, let me know if you need more information and thanks for the good job done. Thanks and Best Regards, William"
156,"Hi Jonathan. I hope this note finds you well! I'm reaching out to discuss the great work you've been doing on the Beta project. As you know, this project is both crucial and time-sensitive (which is the same case as many other projects). I've had a chance to review some of your reports. It's obvious you're super passionate and engaged n the work, and have a hunger to share not only the facts, but also your POV. While this is great, when we're sending out reports to leadership, we have to make sure we're being mindful of their busy schedules/competing priorities. I think we have a chance to help streamline your comms so they're super easy to digest and don't require many rounds of revision before going out the door. I've included a couple best-in-class examples of reports, for you to review. I'd like you to familiarize yourself with this format, taking note of the content included - and not included. You'll note that they just have the facts, not commentary. A hunger to showcase your curiosity and insights is great, but these comms must only include facts. There are other forums we can create to ensure your passion isn't being kept at bay, but we need the reports to be really tight. As a next steps, please shoot me a copy of your next report, using this template. From there, I'll provide some quick notes to help ensure we're modeling the template and setting up the comms in a tighter way for leadership. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Look forward to seeing the updated template from you. Keep up the good work! William"
85,"Jonathan, I am very excited about your enthusiasm in working on this Beta project. However, I do want to address some areas of concern in regards to your reports for the project. There has been an ask that you are a bit more concise with only including the facts of your findings and less suggestions. We need to make sure that the other team members can get the information they need to assess the situation and perform their portion of the project. In order to accomplish this task, I have a training class that I would like for you to attend on report writing so that you will have the tools you need in order to succeed.I am really excited to hear about all of your suggestions from what you are learning and would like to set a time to meet with you so that I can hear about all of these suggestions that you may have and we can get them shared in a different platform. Again, thanks for all you are doing to make this project a success!"
100,"Jonathan, I would like to let you know that I am happy you are excited about your participation in the Beta project. I would also like to share some insights and coaching with you. It has been brought to my attention that your reports are being submitted with commentary and opinion instead of the desired fact based analysis the project requires. I would like to help you be more valuable to the team to make sure you have a shot at that promotion you are looking for.First, please seek out a business writing course. You can contact HR to inquire about available company resources. If ABC-5 does not offer a course I would ask that you research outside sources. This will give you an opportunity to improve yourself and be more valuable to the company as a whole.Second, until you have completed that course please keep your reports fact based. Your valuable commentary and opinions can be submitted via email or as an addendum of the report, but do not include it in the reporting document. This will help the team to quickly decipher the information and be able to report up to the steering committee. this approach will help the team greatly, but also give you the opportunity to provide feedback. Third, I would like you to follow up with me in a month to let me know how the business writing course has helped you. I would love to understand the value of the course you took so that we can assess it as a development tool for the rest of the team. Jonathan, understand that the Beta program is very important and you are a valuable team member. Also understand that you following reporting guidelines is imperative. Rework and deciphering fact from opinion slows the team down. Can I have your commitment that you will follow through with these actions and work to improve your skills for the betterment of the project? Thank you, William. "
142,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you for all your efforts in helping collect information for the company! Your data are invaluable to our successes. I recently reviewed one of your technical reports and have a few thoughts on it. In order for the readers of your reports to gather all the relevant information quickly and efficiently, your reports need to be more concise. Since everyone, including yourself, is very busy, the reports only should contain the relevant technical information. You may provide some additional commentary if asked by the reader. This will streamline our processes and ensure a smooth transfer of data. I would like for you to review some reports of Alex to see examples of how they should be completed. I have informed Alex of this and he should be setting up a meeting to go over any questions you may have. We can also arrange for you to attend an outside writing course at a local university if that interests you. I know you have been putting in a lot of effort and are enthusiastic about all the information you gather to support our work. This is greatly appreciated. If your reports become more concise & technically proficient, this will only help your career move in a positive direction. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further. Best, William"
127,"Dear Jonathan,  Hopes you are well. Thank you for your message. I would like to talk with you about the below points. (It is about the report preparation for Beta project) I have some feedback about your report. It is really useful to find relevant information and insight. However, somebody think that the report need to concise.  Do you have any reason/rationale to make the report like this ? If you have any problem to make a concise report, I and our team can help to you. Before send the report to Beta project team, why don't you send me the draft report ?It that case, we can make more clear & concise report and we can get organize our insight. After that, your report will be wonderful not only for you but also your Beta project team.  This is our opinion. If you have more good idea or opinion, please let us know. Best regards, William "
64,"Hi Jonathan, I want to tell you something regarding your work on Beta project. I know you are working on this project with lots of enthusiasm and writing a good report with lots of perspectives of your own on this report. But I would like to inform you that you would only need to provide only technical information on this project because your project report is getting very detailed and some information is of no use to the concerned stakeholders. Terry informed me that he has to spend lot of time in fine tuning your report. Hence please keep this in mind before writing the new report about this project I know you can contribute well in this project but we should only stick to the task we have been assigned. And you should also focus to improve on your business writings. I trust you have understood my message and you will work as per the instruction received for work in this project."
172,"Hi Jonathan, Thanks for your continued efforts on the Beta project. I know you have put a lot of extra time and effort into this project. This is a great opportunity to provide valuable insight to the teams and further develop your ability to support the team. Now that you have experience with project team I would recommend getting feedback from your stakeholders to ensure we are meeting their needs. Please setup time with each team member individually to understand how they are using your report and what information is most valuable to them. After getting feedback from the team could you please send a summary of the feedback and any improvements you feel would help ensure we meet their needs?Please keep in mind some of the feedback might be critical, but it is important to periodically check with our stakeholders to ensure we are meeting their needs. You are a valued member of the team and I feel this step will help ensure we get the maximum benefit of your passion for this assignment. Keep up the great work, William"
154,"Hi Jonathan, I just heard from Terry. He had some good things to say about your contributions and commitment to the project. He also shared some concerns he had about the written reports you had submitted to him. I believe that most of these concerns are due to the fact that you have not been done a lot of business writing before. Since the reports are critical and time-bound, it is imperative that they are concise and contain minimal commentary. There is an upcoming training on business writing skills, why don't you enroll for the same. It would help you improve your soft skills and also help you grow in the    organization. Let me know if you have any concerns. Warm regards, William"
78,"Jonathan, I want to touch base with you on some feedback that I have heard from the Beta project team. First off I want to say that the team feels that you are a good contributor and that you identify improvement opportunities but they are struggling with a couple of your work habits. The first is that you include too much commentary in your reports. Your reports should contain only technical information and not your perspectives. Going forward you need to improve this and stick to the facts. In addition to this you need to focus on the organization of your reports. Your reports influence some important decisions at ABC-5 and should be the best reflection of your capabilities every time. When your reports are not concise and accurate then they have to be edited by a team member. Because of this feedback I am asking you to think of ways that you can improve your reports and writing skills. Please send them to me by EOB tomorrow and I would also like your commitment that you will work with me to find alternate ways to improve in these areas such as mentoring with a team member that is a great report writter or additional training etc. If you want to stay on the team it is necessary that you improve in both of these areas and I will support you in developing and implementation of an improvement plan over the next 30 days. Please be ready to discuss a 30 day improvement plan by the end of the week. Regards, William "
96,"Hi Jonathan, I'm reaching out to follow up on some feedback I've gotten for your work on the Beta project. Overall, the team really enjoys working with you and they've even pointed out a few improvements you've suggested that have been extremely valuable! I know you're relatively new at this and have been working diligently to get these reports out with a lot of detail and important content. Since you're working so hard and are keen on improving your work and advancing in the company, I think it'd be really valuable to review feedback with other stakeholders of your work on the Beta team. Over the next week or so, please ask Terry to share some of the final edited versions of the reports he's submitted. I think it'll be helpful for you to see what content he's keeping and what he isn't. Remember - people really value your insight on this but content edits can be necessary to play to the correct audience so please keep an open mind. I'd recommend paying attention to final content and clarity and brevity of the article.Remember - often times these are getting passed tot he CEO for reading! They need all the pertinent fact immediately apparent to make fast and accurate decisions.I think with some final product input, we can really make your reports shine to all the people watching as the Beta project proceeds. As we go along, let's keep in contact about it. I want to see you succeed in this role as you clearly have the talent and the passion so let's get these reports dialed in. don't hesitate to give me a call with any questions, William"
173,"Good morning Jonathan, I received your video message and you seem very excited about the Beta project and the critical work your doing.  Im looking forward to your report but I did want to bring up a couple things that may help you.  I dont know if we covered this before assigning you this project but the group your reports go to are responsible for presenting them to the CEO who is looking for the facts about your findings in order to make critical decisions.  I would like you to keep this in mind when you write your next report so you can keep it fact based in the body of the report and add your opinion or solutions as an addendum as a separate piece at the end.  They are also very busy and sometimes may need to hand your report directly to the CEO without going through it beforehand.  With this in mind please write it as a fact based business report that may end up on the CEOs desk. This is a great opportunity fo you to have access to upper management and allow you to pursue your career growth within the company if done correctly. Please email me when you receive this with questions and the changes you will make to your future reports.  We can talk about specific examples if needed. I would like to than you again for your passion and energy for the Beta project."
171,"Hi Jonathan, I'm contacting you with regards to your current assignment in the Beta project. I'm glad you are enjoying the work and it gives you a lot of satisfaction. But we need to work the results you are delivering. It came to my attention that the reports you are creating have to much if information and additional comments which makes it difficult to analyze them and create an executive summary. I understand that you would like to share as much information as possible and I'm sure your additional input can be of a great help to the team so I would like you to try the following: - in the report as well please include exclusively the technical information as requested by the Beta project leader - all your other remarks, findings and proposals you can then notedown separatelyrather than include in the report itself.  Please get in touch with Terry and check for any other guidance he may have for you. We will revisit the situation once I'm back in two weeks."
24,"Hi Jonathan, Ive been hearing great things about the work you do on the Beta project. Your contributions and the improvement opportunities you have identified have been great for the growth of the project. The reason of my message today is to help you improve on the delivery of the great ideas you have shared and contributed.As you know, your reports are highly valued by a number of high- ranking managers and they are pivotal in helping the management make key decisions.Some feedback have been received that the reports provided would have a greater effect if they came in a concise manner. I would like you to try and shorten the report and attempt to only include technical information but keep up the suggestions on improvements as a separate segment in the report. That way, we would be able to provide more timely reports catering to the wide audience in mind. You are a great engineer and i believe that development in business writing is a critical skillset that would help further your career.As you have mentioned, sometimes the sheer amount of information to collate is overwhelming. for this week, i would like you to start off early with penning down all the technical information and run them through Terry. Have a session to get a prioritization of information to be placed in the report. Get his inputs so that both of you would be able to come up with a report which is concise and on time. Great to have you on the team."
140,"Hi Jonathan, Trust that your traveling has been going well.I am writing to provide you with some feedback regarding your reports for the Beta project. I understand that you have contributed tremendously to the project and has been an asset to the team. However, I think your reports still has further room to improve. Specifically, the clarity, conciseness and technicality of the report. I will explain the in detail the rationale below:1) Commentary: as you know, this is a business report, decision makers would only want to see technical information which are free from personal opinions. Sometimes, opinions could be wrong either due to our biasness or our lack of knowledge, hence facts based report would make the report more credible.2) Length: As this report is for our customer or CEO, they would appreciate if the report is high level, containing only information that they have to know to make a decision. Furthermore, they are extremely busy and thus would prefer the report to be straight to the point.Going forward, I hope you could take note of them and give them a deeper thought. I can definitely see you succeeding and excelling if you are willing to change . If you have any information or want any clarifications, I am happy to chat with you. All the best, and keep up the positivity and enthusiasm. I look forward to see your new report."
20,"Hi Jonathan, Really glad to hear you are enjoying working with the team and the Beta project. To enable you to grow within the team further it would be useful to conduct a lessons learnt session on the reports completed to date with myself so we can drive continuous improvements making the reports sleeker and concise. I appreciate you don't have a great deal of experience with business writing so this will help make sure you are on the right track. It is important the facts speak for themselves in these reports and opinions are set aside.I also think it is important you to take on board Terry and the other team members feedback which will add to the quality of the reporting. Once i can see development and your commitment to taking on the above we can discuss further your promotion.  thanks, William"
3,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are well. It is great to see your enthusisatic participation in the Beta Project. We are glad you are contributing. As i have not been able to connect with you personally, thought of e-mailing a few areas you could focus on to develop further and effectively contribute. I have also collected feedback from team members on the project and recommend these next steps. Significance of Reports: The reports you prepare are tabled with the leadership and support decision making. Hence need to be concise and precise. This could be an area for you to develop further given your aspirationsAction: Would suggest you present the report in 2 sections: FACTs and Your Suggestions/Opinions. This will enable them to understand the facts objectively and judge your thoughts better Development: As your job entails a significant amount of report writing, i highly recommend you to take up a learning course on executive business repiort writing. I shall take this up with the HR team and nominate you for the best course on the subject. Progress: Let us set-up a monthly check-in to monitor your development and for you also to share any feedback. Regards William"
183,"Hi Terry, Thank you for the information. I will reach out to Jonathan to schedule a meeting to discuss your concerns. I will let him know that I want to schedule some time to review the project, how things are going and discuss any feedback from himself or I. I will start the conversation with Jonathan by thanking him for all of his efforts on this project, I know his is very excited to be apart and I am truly grateful. I will address this is a great opportunity to gain visibility from key leaders and help with potential future advancement. I will ask him to begin sharing 15 minute updates on my weekly staff meeting with the team. This is where he can share his excitement thoughts and details, which are not not be included in the report. I will emphasize only facts in the formal business report as this is the profession approach and standard. I will gain his committment as he and I will do a weekly debrief of the information he shares before he submits and I will can provide coaching. In addition, I will connect him with our wordsmith on the team to help give pointers on a business writing and structure. He will be aware that if he cannot abide we may need to remove him from the project. I will open it up for any feedback and thoughts for Jonathan reassuring him that is contribution is appreciated and I know we can refine a few things to be better "
132,"Hi Jonathan, Hope your travel is going well and you aren't too sick of airport food yet!  Your reports are starting to get wider circulation and are critical to meeting or exceeding the sales targets.  As your efforts and multitude of detailed insights are getting noticed by more and more senior staff, there seems to be a need for an Executive Summary, as well, some end users are having difficulty pinpointing the details they need.  Meanwhile some users just require the high-level highlights .  I am hoping you can introduce a 1-page Executive Summary to summaarize the details and continue to attach the full report for reference but also add a Table of Contents by region/sector to make it easier to locate details.  I think this change will go a long way to make the report more palatable to all end users.  These two changes will help get the report noticed and used in decision making process under senior leadership and perhaps will lead to future opportunities to present. Could you please send me a draft of the next release of the report.  Let me know if you need any support, we just had a new hire start that could possibly help take care of this reformat between your busy flights.  Also let me know if you had any ideas to better meet the needs. thanks! William           "
31,"Hi Jonathan, Thanks for your continued support to Terry on the Beta Project. Your contribution in collecting technical information has been very useful, however there are few concerns / improvement areas that are critical for Terry and is also expected in your support. I would like to discuss those with you. We have identified these issues:1) You need to separate facts from opinions. The main objective here is to prepare a concise report gathering  technical information that could be used by Terry team. Though you make have good insights, but trust me will not add a lot of value here.2) We see we need to work on your business writing skills that helps make the report more presentable and organized. As you know this report is shared to senior management, this aspect is very critical. Jonathan, I understand your excitement, commitment and the learning opportunity on this project, however pls understand we need to work in manner that helps achieve a common shared objective for the complete team. Many people are supporting in this project and expectations are clear from each one.To meet your expectations, improvement in above two areas are very critical. I hope you will understand and come to me with clear understanding on how you plan to work on these. Looking forward to your committeemen and prompt response on this. Thanks."
52,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you for some of your insights on the Beta project, I have recieved some good feedback!There are a few things that I think would help make your contributions more valued. Considering the time and  effort being put into this by you, and other stakeholders , these will go a long way in taking this to the next level. Considering your future aspirations in this role, I want your report to be the final presentation that is shared with customers, instead of a draft that others need to edit or modify - this will give you the right visibilty with senior leadership, and build your reputation as a trusted senior advisorCan you set up a discussion with Terry, and ask him to share with you the final versions of your reports that are sent to clients - it will help you evaluate what needs to change.I understand some of these might even require training in business writing, so it would even help to participate in upcoming trainings on the subject - you can speak to HR about schedules and costs, I would be more than happy to fund this. Good luck !Regards William"
141,"Good morning Jonathan, I hope you are well.  I would like to circle back with you regarding the reports that are being sent in. Unfortunately, we are not able to speak live but here are some key points to the way our reports need to be constructed as per the company’s standards. It is critical we keep to the main points for reporting to management. For example, if we add too much of our opinion it may mislead the direction or feedback given. Please ensure your reports are in the format we reviewed; bullet pointed with just the facts.You can always discuss your opinions after with Terry. Secondarily, I would recommend you scheduling a weekly conference call with Terry to work on the way we organize and construct the reports. This will further support upper managements review and understanding of data shared. Will you be able to meet these requirements?  I know you have high aspiration and professional goals to grow and look forward to supporting you getting there. These are some ofthe first steps to ensuring your future success within ABC-5. I will be checking in with Terry monthly to ensure we see improvement. Please let me know if you have questions, concerns or if this direction is not clear. Kind regards, William"
84,"Hi Jonathan, I have been in contact with Terry regarding your work on the Beta project. We appreciate all of the hard work that you have been doing, and your professional feedback. I understand that there has been some confusion regarding what is helpful in these reports. Specifically regarding separating technical facts from opinions. While your insights are valuable, perhaps they could be included as an additional note, so that Terry is able to use the technical facts more easily digest your reports.Additionally, report writing for business can be a complicated task. I would like you to complete a business writing course that we will find for you, and use these skills to further improve the quality of your reports.I feel that making these changes will help the team, and help you to further your career with ABC-5.Please cc me on future reports, so that I can continue to be of assistance to you if required.Please respond, and acknowledge your commitment to these tasks.Thank you, William"
45,"Thanks Jonathan for your report. It's all clear but unfortunatly, however, I had to do it because it was too long and not focused on the important points. I saw the enthusiasm with which you prepared the report but it is necessary, for the next time, to be more concise and direct by focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of the project needs and next steps. It is important to be concise and direct so as not to frustrate the effort that we make every day, you first. Attached you will find the modified report from which you can see the readjustment of the info contained in yours in a clearer and more concise way. We don't use too many words to express a concept, let's get straight to the point, you will see that our superiors will appreciate more. For the next report, try to pick up on the attached structure and maybe send it to me a few days before the deadline so that we can work on it together and meet the deadline. Thank you very much for the work done and the enthusiasm you put into your work every day."
117,"Hi Jonathan,I hope your travels are going well! I received some feedback regarding your work on the Beta project that I would like your help in solutioning. I understand that you are really excited and enjoy working on the Beta Project, and we are really excited to have your energy! However, I want to make sure that we are making best use of your energy in moving in a helpful direction for the team. Specifically, I'd like to focus on making the reports more concise and structured in our standard way - and then put your extra ideas and efforts towards additional research initiatives.  I understand that you have lots of ideas and comments around the research that you're doing. For the reports, however, We need the reports to remain as streamlined and consistent as possible to ensure that our consolidated report works smoothly. As a result, I would like you to schedule a meeting with Terry to cover the following items: Review the report format. I know that you are new to the team, and this is a great learning opportunity to make sure that only the facts are included in the report that are required.Ask Terry about additional ways to provide your ideas. Perhaps hold a weekly discussion to review the information and provide your colored commentary. Terry will have additional ideas that you two can discuss. Before submitting your report this week, please also ask for a peer review from one of your co-workers. This is a great opportunity for you to meet and learn additional tips and tricks from your colleagues. Please send me a note and let me know how these things go. I look forward to hearing the solutions you come up with. I want to support you in your growth at this company, and look forward to partnering with you. Warm Regards, William"
77,"Jonathan your reports are very helpful for decision making. But there are little longer with additional perception of yours. It shows that how much time and effort you have spent in typing those reports unnecesarily. You should write efficient report with concise information which ultimatly gives you more time to dig up more technical informaiton and travel more.I hope you understand my way of thinking of writing concise information which will end up more time for your technical knowledge gains and traveling. Please try this approch and let me know the effect after one month.When you approch the above methodology, can you please keep track of additional knowledge gain which you have achieved for next month. Also keep track of travel hours. You will see the result overwhelming. I believe in your work. Only thing is when you divert your efforts in learning more than writing efforts, you will gain more. Of course you need to put your technical knowledge on paper. But generally scientific reports contains facts only. Don't you agree with me?"
181,"Hi Jonathan I am contacting you because of your performance at the Beta project. Your current effort is appreciated a lot by the team and I get a lot of positive feedback about your extra mile you are going. Thank you for your work and committment! Nevertheless, there are also some points which could influence the work to be more efficient and effective. Especially your reports could be improved. Currently, they include a lot of details which are not always necessary. Please focus on the most important points and use the project meetings to address any points of improvement or general inputs.Another point is the writing. Please stick to the common business style writing, otherwise it can be misleading to other project memebers. You can find support on the buisness writing style online or we can enrol you in a class by Learning & development from HR. Moreover, the team is here to help and support in case of questions. When those two points are solved, I think you are one step closer to your next career step. I am happy to discuss the options in you next performance review. Let me know if there is anything to help you with or there are open questions. Best regards!!"
162,"Hi Jonathan, hope you are enjoying your time and work on the Gamm project? I received some positive feedback from your contributions to the project, so I am glad that your engagement has a positive effect! In particular, you seem to accumalte a lot of useful information of the project, which is very good. On the other hand, I am also received feedback from people working with the reports, that it is hard for them to actually process all the information contained within. This isn't to say the information you gathered is useless, it just needs to be presented in a more structured and concise form. I know you being a technician, this isn't always easy, but it really is something you need to work on to make your work even more effective. As a hint, try to take on the perspective of the people reading the reports: can they follow your thoughts, do they have quick access to the information they need? We might also think about setting up a training for you helping you on this line of work.I know that your goal is to become a technical lead and I definitely see you on the way there with the experiences you make on the Beta project. Part of that job is to also present information in the way described above, so the people you lead can act efficiently. By working on this, you will definitely also learn to be better lead in your future. Please let me know your thoughts on this and continue to have a good and effective time on the Beta project! Brgds, William"
147,"Hi Jonathan, Unfortunately you are travelling at the moment and so I can only address some issues this way.I have been told that we have a lot of follow-up work with your business reports at the moment.There are some complaints here.Unfortunately we can't send your current reports to clients or our CEO. Not without a lot of rework.So you need to work on that.You need to improve the following points.1: Please leave out your personal comments2: Only the facts count in such reports, so please only include them.3: Keep your report short and don't beat around the bush.You are an important employee for me and for ABC-5.I will try to organise an online training for you to become more confident in business reporting.I will also read a report in the future to check the issues raised.Unfortunately, I cannot have these discussions with you in person and it is too important to postpone.I ask you to consider the topics. Best regards, Morgen"
187,"Hi Jonathan, I hope all is well.  I am hearing great things about the information you are gathering for the technical reports.  Since we can't talk live I am hoping we can discuss the reports, and the excellent data you are providing.   The reports you provide are great so thanks for that.  I would like to see if we could streamline your reports.  This may give you more time, and be less overwhelmed, as you mentioned in your video.  If you can modify your reports so that the data comes first.   For immediate quick viewing,  it is easier for the rest of the team to digest the information.  I am not sure if you know that we have some online tools and courses that may help condense some of the information. Again, this may give ease up on your time schedule, and help streamline the reports. What are your thoughts?  I'd like to see if you can give this modified approach to the reports a shot.  Please copy me in on the upcoming report.  If it is helpful, I can have some of the reports that have sent in to give you a framework.  I want you to know that the work you provide is excellent, and if we can organize it so that the data is easily accessible, then the reports can move up the pipeline, and showcase your talent.  As you know Senior Managment sees these reports, and getting the key data points to them in succinct manner will make you even more valuable.  I will have some samples of old reports sent to you.  Once you have compiled your new report, send me a copy, and we can review. Thanks "
19,"Jonathan, I first want to say that I am thrilled with your level of engagement and excitement on the Beta project. Terry mentioned that he spoke with you about your reports.  I hope to provide some context that Terry may have missed. It is important for our team to understand that Terry's engineering team is very time constrained. For that reason, there are two important things we can do in our reports:Take them straight to the key points. Ensure that the reports are polished and ready to hand off to prospective customers.This is a great opportunity for you to develop and demonstrate an elevated level of understanding of key business drivers, which is especially important if you'd like to be promoted to Lead Engineer. Please prioritize finishing your next report 2 days before it is due to engineering so that we have time to review together beforehand. I am happy to provide any extra development opportunities that will improve both the reporting, and set you up for next steps in your career. Sincerely, William"
74,"Jonathan, I just touched base with Terry on the Beta Project and wanted to reach out. This is a great opportunity that senior leadership will be able to see and can really open up doors for you. Because I've worked with senior leadership so much, I know what information they need and what insights, while helpful, is not what they want.Your passion for your job, and being a true team player is why you are so like-able on the team, and everyone appreciates your efforts. However, because this is for senior leaders these reports need to be concise. I struggle with this problem myself - but in order to be moved up to Senior Engineer you will have to adjust your writing to be clear, concise and organized. I will have Terry send you examples of previous business writing. This may give you a better idea of how your reports should be structured. Remember that the C-level people will be reading this, and they are all very factual. This is a great opportunity to show your flexibility and adaptability in your skills and will catapult you to the next step.Terry did mentioned that you have identified improvements that the team didn't even know they needed!  Please keep up the good work - but remember, keep the commentary for discussion, and the facts for the writing. Thank you! "
163,"Hello Jonathan, Terry has been sharing updates with me regarding the Beta Project. We are glad you are bringing your enthusiasm for our technology everywhere you go. Of particular interest is that you had mentioned your desire to be promoted to Terry. Having received feedback on your performance it seems that one of the elements you can improve upon is working on your business reporting. Specifically, creating reports that just state the facts, although we are thankful you are thinking ahead, other ideas that you might have might be better suited elsewhere outside of the reports. You would like to be promoted within a year and I want to make that happen, but in order to do so you will need to be receptive to feedback and improve your business reports. Let me know if you would like to make this commitment with me? I want to make sure you are successful and will do my part to get you there. I just need to know that you are willing to be coached to improve your business reports? Let's succeed together! "
108,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are well. I apologize for not being present this past month due to my commitment outside of our teams responsibilities. I have received some feedback from the team on your recent reports. We need to address them. I understand you receive lots of information and i appreciate this. However, our daily lives are filled with only so many hours. I have to request you to summarize these reports concisely so that your best ideas are highlighted to the team and they spend their time just reviewing these.  I will also ask HR to find you a training program to improve your writing skills. This will help with your development and help you with your personal goals. You are of great value to the team and we want you to improve. I hope you take this positively. We will review your reports when I get back in 2 weeks. Best, William"
150,"HI Jonathan, I'm happy you're excited about the opportunity assembling and creating these reports.  I've had   a look at previous reports and, while there is a lot of good content, I think it may be missing some marks in clarity and structure. Going forward I would be happy to provide you some support and coaching in this, since this is important on your learning journey towards being a lead engineer. What I need from you directly is that you create a report for Terry which is technical in nature and focuses on facts. All the improvements and ideas and insights that you have I suggest you put in a separate report that yous hare with Terry and me so that we can use this material to improve and so that it doesn't get lost."
43,"Hi Jonathan, Terry had talked to me about the Beta project's report that you sent to him. He had some negative comment about the report and you. As I know, you are very experiential in technical and everone like you.Before I make any comment or decision, I will like to hear from your feedback on Terry comment below:-The report is too much commentary and inexperienced with business writing. Please send me a copy of the report future to buy off before. What help needed to improve the report. "
128,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing well. I am getting to hear a lot of positive feedback about your commitment to work and camaraderie with your team. I would like to understand from you if there are any areas you feel you need support on. I would have liked a face to face conversation on this, however because you are travelling and we are unable to speak, I am drafting this note. After some of the feedback I have received, I think it will be good if you review your report writing skills. Look at this very objectively, as a person who may finally be reading this report, what kind of concise information will help the reader understand and grasp the information quickly and make decisions on the same. You must understand the report you make are critical to the business and can make a significant impact . You are creating an image of yourself  and your team in front of the top management with these reports. It will be good to take some feedback from team regarding how to improve the overall quality , as well look at some of the well drafted reports which have been appreciated in the past. My intent is only help you progress and see the big picture. Let us discuss this over a call whenever you get time. Regards William"
168,"Hi Jonathan, Terry shared with me you are working on the Beta project.  Your passion for te project is evident to me as I see your video message!  I appreciate your work on the project and wanted to take this opportunity to share some observations.The feedback from the team is you are a great contributor and the team appreciates having you.  The Beta team really needs technical information on the project to help the team be successful.  It was observed there is additional information in the reports that is more interpretive than factual.  I appreciate the time you take to provide your perspective but what the team really needs now are just facts presented in a concise way.In addition to the team there are often other stakeholders that need the facts of the projects.  They are also constrained for time to a concise report is the most impactful.Long term we can discuss training opportunities.  In the interim I would like to ask that you keep your reports to concise, factual and data driven details.  I am interested in your thoughts on this approach.  The Beta project team really likes working with you and rely on the data for performance.  Can I get your commitment to writing concise reports based on facts?  Thank you in advance! When I am back in town we can review the next report together.  Please share your perspective and commitment. Best, William"
91,"Jonathan, I wanted to converse with you about the Beta Project you have been appointed to work on. Sounds like you are doing a great job of gathering information for the reports in your travels, and unveiling some great findings. I am writing to you though because it has been brought to my attention that the reports you are sendingcould be more clear and concise. Reports you have submitted thus far have had to beedited forclarity as too much time was being spent looking for the needed points. I would like you to reach out to Terry the project leader and ask him to send you a report of yours that has been edited before submission so you can see how information would like to be received. I would like you to copy me in on emails with Terry on this ask, and also on reports that you are preparing to submit for upcoming deadlines. I know you have all the needed experience to do this. We just need to get your knowledge to show in concise reports that will show it."
6,"Hello Jonathan. I haven't been able to meet with you face to face as I have been on special assignment, but I have some feedback I'd like review with you via email. Your reporting have been beneficial but we need to streamline your content to make provide all needed technical details with less commentary. The time it takes to update your reports is taking away from other critical matters. Going forward I want you to review your report after Terry has made updates to understanding what we are looking to receive from you and make sure your current reporting content is similar. I would like a response from you by EOB on Tuesday confirming your commitment to making the changes. Terry will go over your report after your changes to make sure the content is precise and direct. Thanks for your enthusiasm and I look forward to better reporting. Thanks "
72,"Jonathan, I wanted to touch base to check in with you on how your new Beta project is going. I heard you have shown a lot of enthusiasm and have been finding valuable new ways to expand our application of the Beta project. Feedback from the team says you have been contributing great ideas. Your enthusiasm for the project is spilling over a bit much into your reports and they have become lengthy for the team to review. I have reached out to an experienced report writer for you to help you refine your reports so that the details really come through and are easy for the team and clients to understand. I would like you to work with him on this next report and send it to me to review as well.  When I return from this assignment, I would like to sit down with you to personally hear some of your exciting ideas and see if there are other opportunities for you to gain knowledge and learn new processes for future growth too.  Is there anything else I can do for you while I am away? Thanks"
26,"Hi Jonathan, I hear you are doing a great job on the Beta project. Thank you for your contribution. While the technical findings of your report are very insightful and accurate there are some concerns about the length of the report and the manner in which they are structured. As these reports are very important to the organization we need to ensure they are precise, concise and to the point. I have 2 feedback pointers for you which can help you submit a better and a more meaningful report to the team While we value your insights on the technical points within the report, I would request you to segregate the technical findings and your insights into 2 different reports. This would help the team to easily identify the factual points and refer to your commentary for a detailed analysisI would also want you to structure your report in a better manner. Think and structure your thoughts before you start writing. Keep it short and simple and do not over complicate the report. Avoid jargons and pretentious words and be clear and direct. Finally you can get your report reviewed by a peer or your mentor before you submit the report. Lastly, I want you to be more committed and empowered to your deliverables. I do see a lot of potential in you and let us begin with setting career goals and a path to achieve the same. We can have a career discussion sometime this week and let us work on an improvement plan."
35,"Hi Jonathan, How youve been? i hope everything is goind good for you.  I am writing this email for you and i want you to give you some feedback. and i hope soom we can do it in person. I know you have been doing a good job in gathering informationfor the project. and i also, know that you have found opportunities  that nobody noticed. good job on this!

Please lets check the information beetwen us beofre you send the next report. Ill try to let you now what is expected and together we can revise it. I am sure this will increase you goo performance an this will allow that you get in a best position to get promoted. Thanks William"
143,"Hi Jonathan! I hope that you are well! I wanted to reach out in hopes that you can meet with Terry and represent for both of us today. As you know your reporting is the key to our success in moving forward with the Beta Project. A few things I'd like you to be prepared to take to Terry in your meeting with him. - How can we streamline the reports? - I know that you offer a great deal of great information yet we need to see if we can't reduce the information down to specifics. We would like for each results 2 main ideas. Additonal commentary you can do a summary at the end of the report. - Please review timelines with Terry - we need to help get him your great information in a concise timely manner as he needs to relay it up to others that need to understand your feedback quickly and move on to decisions. -I'd like you to ask Terry what specific information that he needs from the reporting and come up with a template that you can use weekly. We put you on this project so that you could continue to learn and grow. I appreciate your help with this and helping us to streamline. We will review when I return, in the meantime thanks for giving your focus to this. "
125,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing well. I heard from Terry that you are part of the team working on Beta project. It is a great learning experience and i hope you are enjoying the role along with all the travel  around the globe. Terry appreciates the insights you bring for the team  with your interactions and experience.My intent of writing this mail is to help you bridge some gap between  the expectation and delivery of the project. As you are aware this is a very critical project with high stakes and deadlines which must be adhered to strictly & hence it is very important to ensure that all the fantastic work you are doing is conveyed in manner which is relevant for end user.While I understand that there is lot of information and insights that you want to share, the reports have to be in a standard format conveying only the technical information required by the team which can be turned into action.My suggestion to you would be to do following to ensure that the issue can be resolved at the same time ensuring that your business writing skills are improved1) Align with Terry on content on the reports  2) Standarize the reports with all required techincal information 3) Reread the reports before sending so as to avoid any error which creeps up during the first writing4) Do read some good memo/business writing books or attend some online course if requiredThis will go a long way in helping you improve professionaly and meet you career aspirations of being lead engineer soon.Please let me know if this is helpful or you want any other help from my end. Thanks & Regards William"
190,"Hi Jonathan, There have been complains that your reports have too much commentary, which make it difficult to extract the facts from them, and that your reports have too detail and are poorly organized. I know you want to be promoted to lead engineer, so let's work together to get the business what you it needs. Firs off, I appreciate the fact that you have suggestions about the data, but how about you add them on a separate section of the report instead of embedding them in the actual data. Also, I would like you to take a business writing  training and have a meeting with Terry's team to get the requirements for the reports. Let's meet again after 2 weeks or at your earliest convenience to see how you're doing. "
111,"Hello Jonathan, Hope this mail finds you well during your traveling for the Beta project. It's good to know that you are bringing great contribution to the team andeveryone in project likes you. Since your reports are important to the success of Beta project, I amwriting this mail toshare my highexpectation that you continue to bring good, clear and concise reports to the team. This will help us save a lot of time and get the main points easily. I believe you are doing great there are rooms for development for the report: + Make it moreclear by separating your commentary and highlight the facts or main point on it. This small adjustment will help the team a lot. + I also know that you haven't experienced with businesswriting but this should not be a big problem to you, I will try to find relevant training courses to get it improved but your self plan to improve it is even make more sense, let me know your plan on this. Please let mereview your next report to see the changes and hopefully I can give some more helpful feedbacks to you then. Thank you, William"
62,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're well and the road is treating you well.I've received really positive feedback from Terry, he's been really impressed with your work ethic and he also mentioned you're coming up with improvement recommendation yourself!! Impressive!!I do however need you help with the way we're collecting the data, as you know these reports are being shared with the CEO and are also customer facing. So we must ensure that when these reports are submitted they should only include the facts and if you have some personal views, you can still share them but not in these reports. You will have to share your opinions separately, as we do value your input, but cannot include them in the reports.We also need to work on your layout when putting these reports together to ensure that they are easy to read and the reader gets all the information you are providing. I understand this isnt human nature to a lot of people and its just something we need to support you with, so going forward you need to have either myself (if I'm around) or someone else review them to ensure the reports reflects the best possible outcome for you and the business. I'm keen to see you succeed and this will be valuable development for you as an individual, especially one day if you were interested in stepping up to a lead engineer position once one became available, this is the sort of development and support you could pass on to junior engineers.Let me know if this makes sense and if you have any concerns. Cheers, William "
61,"Jonathan, I must tell you I am thrilled with the passion and excitement you bring to this role and our organization!  Hey I saw that you referenced wanting to move up to Senior Engineer and I wanted to see if we could get some time to discuss that and lay out an action plan to make that happen.One key component of that is managing up, specifically around reports that you send up.  The information that you are providing is really good, but can sometimes get a little too verbose.  I would love to work with you on keeping that same passion while doing so in a more concise feedback.  Lets schedule some time next week to meet to work on laying out that plan and formatting reports moving forward more in-line with that senior engineering role you are looking for.  Also, maybe a mentor might be of assistance to bounce ideas off of and work with.  We can also have weekly or bi-weekly check-ins to see that the plan we put in is making progress in getting you to where you want to be."
191,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you're doing well.While I appreciate your passion and hardwork, wanted to share a quick feedback regarding your approach. Since Beta is a critical project and report is read by senior leadership. It has to be concise, crisp and immaculate.I would recommend you to go through our online courses to have more hands on experience on report writing. Also, pl seek feedback from more experienced peers and report writers.Shall connect with you after two weeks to see progress.All the best"
65,"Hi Jonathan.I hope all is well!  I am reaching out as I have been informed of the positive work you have been doing on your reports for the Beta project.  Your insights have been very helpful with regard to the necessary improvements.  However, I have received a few pieces of feedback on your work that I would like to share to benefit your efforts.The team here is having challenges with deciphering your technical information and facts from your own personal perspectives on the findings.  While your personal perspective is important, in order to showcase your work efficiently for senior management and our customers, I will need you to work on editing your personal commentary and stating your key message and findings at the top of your reports.I have also received feedback that your reports are unorganized.  It is important to make sure you heavily edit your work before sending it back, so the team is well aware of the most crucial information to share with senior management and our customers.  It is unfortunately taking the team here too much time to go through your reports which is causing them to be late.  Please work on reviewing your reports and making sure the most important information is highlighted in a way that someone could easily review it within a couple of minutes.I hope this information has been helpful.  Please let me know when I am back in the office if I can help you in any way to further your learnings on this topic.  I would like to understand if my feedback was helpful or if there are areas that you feel could be even more improved upon or any trainings you feel could best help you in the future. Thanks, William"
34,"Hi Jonathan.  I hope you are getting a lot of insight and experience while working on the Beta project with Terry.  I hear that it is going well. I'd like to talk with you about your perspective on the project.  This is a great opportunity for your development but we need to ensure that you provide the data that Terry needs for success.  As we discussed on another project, you want to provide high level information which can be quickly digested by Terry and Senior Managers.  The details are your backup for the decision making.I'll set-up some time for us to catch-up."
21,"Hey Jonathan, Hope all is well.I have hear that youve been very busy traveling, learning and making a lot of reports, thats wonderful, I have personally spoken with Terry about these reports and understand that they are too detailed, which in some cases is good but in others it may not be so good.I would like to give you some recommendations about them. How you know our focus and in our DNA we have continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. I consider it essential that you have a meeting with Terry so that he can explain what he needs and so it may be that what you send is very good but for him it is not functional. We could be falling into overworking or making unnecessary efforts.I want to propose the following:1. Make a meeting with Terry so that he can explain his needs, what exactly is expected of you2. Focus on customer needs3. Document what was agreed at the meeting and share it with CC to Terry.With these simple steps I am 100% sure that your work will be even more appreciated, in addition to that it will give me tools to help you to continue developing and well one step close to achieve the goal you have of being Lead engineer.Appreciate your actions and efforts. Regards, William"
199,"Jonathan, I am reaching out to you today for a coaching opportunity with regards to your reporting. I have noticed that your reports are full of extra information. I understand that you are just trying to be more thorough and I appreciate that effort. The problem that we are running into is the time it takes us to weed through the opinions to get to the facts so we can present your findings. Sometimes less is more. Jonathan, we need to be able to trust that your reporting will change. I understand that you want to move up in our organization, and this will go a long way towards showing us that you can do what's best for the company. I would like to proof your next three reports before sending them to Terry, just to make sure we are on the same page. This means finishing those reports at least a day ahead of the deadline, so you need to prioritize your time. Do you foresee any issues with this plan? Thank you, William"
80,"Hi Jonathan, I hope this email finds you well wherever your travels have taken you this week.I am hearing good things about your research and the way you are contributing to the team. I know there can be an overwhelming amount of data at times, and we appreciate your continued effort. I'd like to discuss some of the insights you have been adding to the reports along with the technical information. While your insights are valuable, we must continue to use the data you provide in our decision making. This process will be most efficient if the commentary is left out of the report. You have been instrumental in identifying many issues that we didn't even know we had so your continued effort is much appreciated. We just need more concise observations when it comes to reporting."
14,"Hi Jonathan: I hope you are doing great. Thank you for all the excellent work you are doing and appreciate all the passion you exhibit to get the work done. I want to bring out few points to get more impact on findings you do. Hence my suggestion for you would be following. Once you create the reports, I would like you to go through two three times to look at ares where you can bring in refinement, so that it is crisp and concise. As you know our customers and senior leaderships would love to get most important points/snippets when they read reports. Hence it is important that we give them concise reports which will create first impression and hit on the important points.I think if you can do this, you will improve your research quality and report quality, and bring in a new dimension to your overall skills - which is consulting. That would be an awesome skill to acquire and that would give you tremendous opportunities to grow. At the end of the day, we work to make our customers happy and if our customers are happy with quality of the content we provide, we as a team grow exponentially. I would also suggest to work more collaboratively, seek feedbacks from seniors/peers which will only improve your work. We all come with a view, but it is ok to get another view and weigh in every option to decide the best. We all learn from each other and that make us a better person. Let me know if the above make sense. I will be happy to get into a meeting when you are available to discuss this further. Looking forward to your continuous contribution."
99,"Jonathan: It has come to my attention that there are some concerns with the reports you are submitting for the Beta project. While the reports have some very useful information for the team it tends to have to much commentary. The reports must include technical information only. When you have commentary included with the report, the team requires more time to review the report and identify the critical findings which result in a delay in making decisions and moving forward.You are a critical member of the team at ABC-5. I want to make sure you know we are committed to your success at the company. I am going to work wit HR to identify a business writing course/workshop to help you better understand the types of information and the way it needs to be presented in technical reports. I believe this workshop can go a long way in helping you prepare techincal reports that can allow the Beta Project team to identify opportunities areas to enhance our product in a more efficient and timely manner. Your techincal insights have been helpful and I expect them to continue.Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further. Thanks."
75,"Hi Jonathan! I've heard that your experience on the Beta project was very rewarding for you and that you learned a lot. That's great!I've also heard that Terry has made important remark on your reports and the form of its. I have to said that I agree with him. It's very important that you listen to this point because it could have a major impact on your participation to the project :you have to separate fact form opinion. Your report can contain only facts. Your opinion can is also interesting but you can't put it in the report, maybe you could make a separate document with those information.you have to work on the organization of the reports, there is a classic model on those type of document and when our managers are reading them they except this model. We can't have creativity on that. Don't hesitate to ask Terry if you need more example. For the next report I would like that you send it to Terry one day before the deadline so he can give you his feedback and you can adjust it yourself. It would help you to understand what he expect. I will be back in two week so if there is other non-solved problem on this moment we can work on it together but since my return it's very important for me that you follow that plan. Regards"
44,"Hey Jonathan, I hope all is well! I've been hearing great things about you as usual. However, there has been a few concerns regarding your reports on the Beta project. I understand you are very passionate about your findings however, using the ABC-5 report to voice your thoughts is not the right forum. The ABC-5 team requires concise reports to meet critical deadlines and would greatly appreciate if you could stick to the technical details and facts only. Nevertheless, your insight have identified many improvements for the business and I would still like your voice to be heard. I will setup a meeting with you once I am back to discuss other options of collecting your feedback. Keep up the good work! William."
71,"Hi Jonathan, I wanted to thank you for your time and commitment to the Beta project.  I've heard good things pertaining to your technical reports but I wanted to bring up a couple of things that I think might make the reports more effective.  I noticed that the technical reports contained some opinions instead of facts.  Although your insight in appreciated, I believe it's more effective if we try to limit opinions from the reports.  My other suggestion would be more precise with the reports and try to limit details that might not be beneficial.  I can provide some resources in order to assist with this suggestion.  I believe this would not only benefit the reports for the Beta Project but will add another skill to your resume.  I really appreciate all the work that you've done so far and I hope that it will continue as this project moves along.  Can we set up a time later this week to review these suggestions and see if there are any other ways we can optimize the technical reports?  I hope to speak with your soon.  Regards, William"
