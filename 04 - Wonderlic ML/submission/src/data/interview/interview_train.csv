Question: Can you discuss how you approach setting realistic and effective deadlines, possibly providing an example from your previous work?
Response: I like to do all of my work long before it is due. For example, I am doin this survey right now 5 days before it is due. It is helpful to get these tasks out of the way to focus on other important aspects of life. This may not always be realistic. But, if you always try to do everything before the deadline you will have great time management!Question: Discuss how you adapt to different team personalities. Can you share an instance where this was particularly challenging or rewarding?
Response: When dealing with people with different personalities, you must find a middle ground where everybody is able to contribute their strengths and no one feels like they aren't contributing at all. It can be difficult with conflicting personalities. You should alway try to understand where everyone is coming from and hear everyone's perspective. This is the best way to work effectively as a team. Question: Describe a time when empathy played a crucial role in your workplace interactions.",It's important to understand that your coworkers have lives outside of the job too. Never take anything out too harshly on anyone you work with or you may regret it. You never know what someone is struggling with at home. It's important to always be kind and empathetic towards those you work with. I find that having a positive attitude increases performance and self esteem of those around you. 
R_3HtvjrXwfZ1u6ID,"Question: Everyone faces moments of low motivation. Can you share a story about how you've handled such a moment, including the steps you took to regain your drive and enthusiasm?
Response: During a certain point in my life after multiple personal issues were effecting me, I was struggling to find motivation to do much of anything at all. In this moment, I had to dig into my own thoughts and emotions and find motivation internally instead of doing things for other people, which I previously found myself doing. A particular strategy I used was using these negative emotions as motivation to prove people wrong and complete my goals. Using these negative feelings as motivation allowed me to push myself further then I thought I could I go. I have now found myself continuing to push myself to prove the people wrong who have left my left, and to prove to myself that I can do anything. Question: Can you talk about a time when you had to manage a particularly challenging team member?
Response: On my JV baseball team, one teammate of mine simply did not cooperate. He would show up late to practice, disrespect the staff, and just overall hurt the team. Some people tried to talk to him about the issues, but little changed. I decided to gather myself and some of the other teammates who got along with him a bit better to discuss the issues and why he is was so reluctant to listen to the staff. We discovered some personal issues that he was going through and this allowed us to treat him with respect and to better cater his needs.Question: Recall a period of adversity or challenge for your team. How did you keep morale high?
Response: This past year, my baseball team underwent numerous injuries included myself, having to get my appendix out. Instead of the injured players leaving and not attending team events, we all rallied to do everything we could. We gathered food for the team, helped the coaching staff with scouting, and helped keep player morale high. This dilemma of so many injuries hurt the team, but we didn't let it defeat us. This allowed are team to succeed despite the many key players being out for the season. Question: Recall an instance when you were given constructive criticism. Could you walk me through how you processed it and responded?","When first joined the high school baseball team my senior year, the coach told me that I wouldn't play much at all during the season. After being told this, I asked the coach for reasons as to why he didn't think I was capable, as I certainly thought I was. Being told these criticisms did not knock me down, but instead built goals for myself that I had to break to once again prove the coach wrong. It also gave me the necessary things to work on to play and achieve my goals I had set at the start of the year. This criticism allowed me to work efficiently, and eventually become an everyday starter."

Response: At one of my old jobs, I trained a new employee. I showed him around and where everything was. I told him the basics of the job and what he would do on a day-to-day basis. He picked up on this pretty quickly and ended up being a successful employee, still working there to this day.  Question: Maintaining motivation in repetitive tasks is a challenge. Can you share strategies or personal experiences that have helped you stay engaged and productive?
Response: In the past, I have struggled to maintain motivation in repetitive tasks in a challenge. Some things I have done personally include listening to music, making lists of what needs to be done crossing them off when they get done, and breaking up tasks. This has helped me stay motivated to complete tasks within a reasonable time rather than procrastinating. Question: Walk me through your approach when assessing a new project's requirements.
Response: I would first read the instructions multiple times. If they were long, I would highlight key points to make sure nothing was missed. I would then carry out the project and finally double check everything was completed the way it needed to be. Question: Share a moment when you were faced with a tough decision. How did you deliberate and arrive at your conclusion?","One difficult decision I was faced with recently was during a shadowing shift I had following a neurosurgeon at the hospital. This surgeon had to go tell a guy that his son had experienced severe spinal cord damage and may not be able to walk again. During this conversation, a nurse came and handed me a piece of paper with a phone number and told me to give it to the dad and that he needed to call that number. I had planned to give it to the surgeon since it was not my place to give it directly to the father, but this was an emotional conversation and the father told the surgeon to get out. This meant I had to get out too and it was not an appropriate time to give him this paper, but I didn't want it to be ignored. Another nurse walked in right behind us so I ended up giving it to her.
