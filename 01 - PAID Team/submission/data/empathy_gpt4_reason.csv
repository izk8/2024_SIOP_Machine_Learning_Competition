116,"Hi Jonathan, I hope this message finds you well. I hear things are going well with the Beta project. That said, Terry mentioned that there were some issues with the reports. From what I understand, they would like them to be more concise and straight to the point, as well as more business focused. I recommend you reach out to Terry so you both could review in detail one of the reports he submits. This should help you help you align to their expectations. Additionally, i'd be happy to review the reports before you send them off to Terry and provide my feedback. I know this  project is important to you, so please let me know how this meeting goes and how else I can help. Regards, William",1,"Yes, the email demonstrates empathy and understanding in several ways:

1. ***Acknowledgement of Effort***: The email begins by acknowledging that ""things are going well with the Beta project,"" which serves to recognize Jonathan's effort and contribution, setting a positive tone.

2. ***Constructive Feedback***: Instead of directly criticizing Jonathan's work, the email mentions feedback from Terry in a manner that suggests improvement (""they would like them to be more concise and straight to the point, as well as more business focused""). This approach focuses on the work itself rather than attributing any shortcomings directly to Jonathan, which can feel less personal and more manageable.

3. ***Offer of Support***: By offering to review the reports before they are sent to Terry and suggesting that Jonathan reach out to Terry for detailed review, the writer provides direct avenues for Jonathan to improve his work. This shows a willingness to assist and guide, rather than just critique.

4. ***Expression of Confidence***: The closing remark, ""I know this project is important to you,"" demonstrates understanding and empathy regarding Jonathan's commitment to the project. It underscores the writer's support and confidence in Jonathan's ability to improve and succeed.

Overall, the email balances the delivery of critical feedback with support and encouragement, which are key aspects of demonstrating empathy.",yes,did

1,"Hi Jonathan, Good to hear you are enjoying the work. I would like to discuss with you feedback on your assignment and the reports you are producing. It is very important to understand the stakeholders who will be reading your report. You may have gathered a lot of good information BUT do not put them all on your reports. The report should state facts and not your opinions. Create reports for the purpose and for the audience. I would also suggest that you reach out to Terry to understand what information is needed on the reports you produce.Having said that, the additional insights you gathered are very important too. Please add them to our knowledge repository and share with the team. It will be a great sharing and learning experience. You are very valuable in your knowledge and I think that it would benefit you and the organization tremendously when you are to channelize your insights and present the facts well.

However,  it has been brought to my attention that perhaps ABC-5 didn't do enough to prepare you for the extra work and I would like to discuss some issues. The nature of these reports requires them to be technical in nature.  Your insights are very valuable and much appreciated but as the old line goes ""please give me just the facts"".  Given the critical nature of the information you are providing I can't stress the importance of concise yet detail factual reports.  I would like to review your reports as a training exercise to help you better meet the team requirements.  Given that there are some major reports coming up in the immediate future, I would like you to review some training options and then present a report for review.  Again your insights are appreciated but we need to make sure we are presenting the end-use with only the information they need to make a sound business decision. I also understand you would like to grow into a leadership position so I would like to discuss how successfully implementing these changes would be beneficial in demonstrating an ability to grow and take on new challenges.

It mentions that his insights are valuable but quickly shifts to criticism and the need for him to change his approach, which could feel dismissive.

I've been in touch with Terry, I'm so glad to hear how much you are enjoying the Beta Project, I even hear you are hoping that this experience will further your ambitions toward a Lead Engineer position! However, I understand there has been some issues with your reports that Terry has brought up with you, and I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss them.1) Opinion vs. FactsYour reports contain a lot of insights about what the data means, and at times finding the specific hard facts can be difficult.2) Level of DetailYou include every bit of data that you can into your reports, which can make it difficult to take away the larger picture.I want to encourage you to take these things away for the following reasons:1) your reports are reviewed by everyone in upper management, including the CEO! The opinions you have are great, but when evaluating documents the CEO just needs to highest level, most important items. The nitty-gritty would fall to another department2) as you have a desire to move up and be a Lead Engineer, these kinds of reports will be more and more common. Keeping your thoughts organized and well documented is going to become a very important skill to have.For your next report I would like you to prepare a cover sheet that goes with the report. This cover sheet should be a single page highlighting only the key facts of the report. Your own opinions and analysis can be included, but let those who are interested read it on their own time, the high level facts are key for the meeting they will be presented in.

It is about your reports' style. Please try to focus purely on facts, not so much on your own conclusions or opinions (you can write these down separately and discuss with me and/or Terry). To make the Reports as clear and understandable to all who read and work with them, they need to contain the plain facts only. Please make sure you consider this for the future. To support you there, I have found a training that will help you get better on this that I suggest you attend after your return.

I appreciate your commitment, and I know that travel isn't always easy.  Terry has shared some of your reporting techniques with me. While we appreciate your insights and attention to detail, we are going to need you to shift gears a little to help the team make their deadlines.  It is difficult for the team to easily separate facts from opinions in your reports, and it would be much easier for them to pass on the great information you're sharing if your reports were more concise and organized.I know this change in work habit might be a challenge for you, but it is imperative for the success of the project.  That being said, I've come up with a game plan for getting your reports to where the team needs them to be for success.  Terry has a lot of experience in business writing, and since he is responsible for passing on your reports to customers and our executive leadership team, I've asked him to sit with you for a couple of hours this week to share some of his edits on your previous reports.

Please take this opportunity as a learning experience, and reach out to Terry ASAP to schedule the time!

1. **Sandwiching feedback**: While the email starts and ends on a positive note, creating a ""sandwich"" with the criticism in the middle, it might not spend enough time acknowledging Jonathan's efforts and circumstances in a meaningful way. This could make the positive comments feel like a mere formality.

2. **Lack of Specific Praise**: The email mentions that Jonathan has been ""identifying some great improvements"" but does not go into detail about what these were. Specific praise can significantly boost the sense of empathy because it shows genuine attention and appreciation.

3. **Assumptions about Overwhelm**: While the email mentions the possible overwhelm due to travel and workload, it doesn't acknowledge or inquire about Jonathan's personal experience. A more empathetic approach might have included questions asking how Jonathan is coping or offering support.

4. **Solution Offering Without Dialogue**: The email suggests training as a solution without first seeking Jonathan's perspective on his challenges with report writing. An empathetic approach would typically involve a dialogue, asking Jonathan if he feels he would benefit from such training or if there are other forms of support he might find helpful.

5. **Missed Opportunity for Encouragement**: While the email ends on a positive note, more could have been done to encourage Jonathan and make him feel supported. Phrases like ""I believe in your potential,"" or ""I know you can turn this into an opportunity for growth,"" could have further demonstrated empathy and confidence in his abilities.

In essence, while the email attempts to be empathetic by mixing praise with constructive criticism and suggesting solutions, a deeper display of understanding, specific recognition of efforts, genuinely inquiring about Jonathan's experiences, and stronger encouragements could have enhanced the empathy conveyed.",no,did not

In general, the team is happy about your skills in contribution and espacially your way to identify improvements they may would have not seen. At first, your technical reports contain too much commentary that are not neccessary and make the report too long.

1. **Direct and Harsh Feedback without Softening Language**: The feedback is direct and can come across as harsh without using softening language that could have helped cushion the impact. Phrases that may sound critical, like ""your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be,"" can be demoralizing without the balance of more personalized, empathetic language.

2. **Lack of Specific Praise**: While it mentions that the team appreciates Jonathan's skills and ability to identify improvements, it lacks specific examples of what he has done well. Specific praise can help soften the blow of the criticism.

3. **Potential Removal from the Project**: Mentioning that Jonathan might be removed from the project team can induce anxiety and doesn't necessarily encourage improvement. While it's important to communicate potential consequences, framing it in a way that focuses on the desire for his improvement and continued contribution could have been more empathetic.

4. **Improvement Suggestions at the End**: Suggestions for improvement and offers of support come after the criticisms have been laid out, which could lead to the recipient feeling overwhelmed or discouraged before reaching the more supportive suggestions.

5. **Personal Connection and Understanding**: The email could have benefited from more personal understanding and connection, acknowledging Jonathan's efforts and expressing confidence in his ability to improve with given support. A more empathetic approach would involve acknowledging any difficulties he may be facing, especially considering his travel, and offering more immediate reassurance of his valued place in the team.

You travels must be exhausting and I appreciate your commitment to our work. While your reports are detailed, the Engineers are finding that they are not technical enough and contain too many opinions. Please be concise in your reports and consider the audience as you are preparing them. Too many details make reading them cumbersome and the reports you are sending need to be edited for clarity. This is causing unecessary downstream work and does not reflect well on your performance. Perhaps we can discuss and plan for your attendance at a technical writing seminar in the near future. Please let me know if you need support in finding technical writing improvement courses or if you can correct on your own now that you are aware this has been highlighted.  Please cc me on your next report so I can review.

I appreciate you taking the time to send Terry a message about your upcoming report and I do love that you are enthusiastic about the project.

What I think it means. My thoughts).

Terry will provide guidance as to what he sees other reports look like and you can provide your most imprortant info to him so he can highlight it without having to guess.
