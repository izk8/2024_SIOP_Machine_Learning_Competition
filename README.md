# SIOP 2024 Machine Learning Competition

The repository holds competition data, winning solutions / code, and presentations. 


## Competition Overview

This year, we decided to focus on large language models (LLMs). For more information on LLMs, please visit our [LLM primer](LLM primer.pdf).

LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing. By training on massive text datasets, LLMs can generate human-like text and excel at diverse linguistic tasks. However, thoughtfully harnessing the potential of LLMs for the field of I-O Psychology requires rigorous design and evaluation. This year's competition focused on developing best practices for applying LLMs to I-O tasks. Competitors were required to develop LLM workflows through techniques like prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning using standardized datasets relevant to I-O Psychology. The goal is to benchmark techniques that unlock LLMs' potential as aids for I-O Psychologists through careful design and experimentation. Our goal was to organize a competition that reveals the current abilities of LLMs to assist with workflows in I-O Psychology using public benchmark datasets. Participants report reproducible prompts, results, and analyses to advance best practices for thoughtfully eliciting the strengths of LLMs for professional applications. 

Benchmark Datasets

- Predicting Empathy: Job candidates were asked to provide empathetic responses to a difficult workplace situation. Your task is to classify whether empathy was demonstrated or not in each simulated response. 
- Generating Interview Responses: Job candidates responded to 5 common interview questions. You will be given the text of 4 question and response pairs. Your task is to generate a likely text response for the 5th question based on the previous responses. 
- Rating Item Clarity: Respondents rated the clarity of personality test items using a 7-point scale from 1 = extremely unclear to 7 = extremely clear. Your task is to predict the average clarity rating for each item based on the responses.
- Identifying Fairness Perceptions: Respondents compared two organizational policies and voted on which was fairest. Your task is to identify which policy received the majority vote as the fairer option.
