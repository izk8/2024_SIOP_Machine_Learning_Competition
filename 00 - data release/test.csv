interview,R_5vFv7rpdBbXvdOp,"When I was in ninth grade, we had to do team building activities. We all participated in the human knot. This is when everyone interlocks hands then mixes them around so that we are stuck. We had to use communication to free ourselves before the other team did, I was feeling shy and quite. I noticed one move that could help and when I finally spoke up, it really helped and we escaped first. ",
interview,R_27p8OTfSoIRVsEf,I took the ciriticism and I used it wisely.,
interview,R_1oBZEQmlIv9jPFn,"There have been times during the day that I have been working on schoolwork in a scheduled time when I was stopped from being able to continue. One specific time, I had dedicated a piece of my day to completing assignments and my room mates or friends have needed to be dropped off somewhere for their various activities and jobs. In these cases, I stopped what I was doing to help my friends and finished my work instead of going on a run.",
interview,R_1GDNVDR2SEt3p32,"I was once asked to instruct a paint class at my previous job. This required a lot of responsibility, as I did not want to make myself nor the company look bad. I also dealt with many rude and impatient customers, which was hard. I had to maintain a positive attitude and environment. This required a lot of patience on my part, making sure the attendees of my class were content and happy.",
interview,R_3dFVA0cZ7FDfIfM,"My first step to solving a problem is stepping back and thinking until I find a solution. When I was younger, I was visiting my grandparent's house, and my dog ran away and went onto the golf course behind their home. I chased her down and caught her, but due to her size and stubbornness, I was not able to bring her back to the house alone. My next step usually involves seeking teamwork to solve problems. I decided to wait until a golfer drove by, and ask them for help. Eventually I was able to flag one down, and he drove my dog and I up to the house in his golf cart.",
interview,R_vP3z9YIgQHyKnMR,"I was given multiple projects in the terms of exams. I had 3 exams within 48 hours of each other, and I had to make a schedule. I schedule chunks of time were I could allocate each section of time to the test. This allowed less distress and I knew I had a plan that I could fall back on. The main goal was to not get distressed with all of the studying, but still have time for all of the exams. ",
interview,R_3Jypqo9SHWUiqa4,"When working at my local country clubs golf-merchandise store, I was confronted with bossy customers who would get upset with me for things I did not have control over. There were situations where I felt like getting angry and raising my voice, but I had to remind myself that there are ways to comply with uncompliant customers that do not involve elevated emotions. I learn that you can still be respectful and vigilant while also not allowing someone to take advantage of your kindness. It is important in the workplace to be able to negotiate with difficult people, and always reminding yourself that you treat others how you want to be treated, no matter how they are treating you. At the end of the day we are all human and have good and bad days. ",
interview,R_1hPV5dsJOAdC6By,I believe success is determined by our goals and what we predict from our mission of why we started the project. Some people may perceive success as to how many people see you succeed but I believe if you feel proud of the work you have done that's the only success you need. At a competition if you place first you may feel you have succeeded but what of that was by default. You may then feel like a failure while everyone else sees you as a winner. ,
interview,R_2mfYVKZMKd7PnuF,"As a summer swim team coach, creativity was crucial in getting the large team of over 100 kids to cooperate and listen. Coming up with fun practice schedules was very important and as the Senior Assistant Coach, I worked hard to come up with great ideas such as a charades practice and encouraged the younger coaches to think of other ideas as well.",
interview,R_XocaBp07qLvlOCt,"Task-switching can be detrimental to work quality, so I make sure to chunk out at least an hour for a project before switching to another one. While applying to colleges, I was juggling many applications at once. Some were even due on the same day. I just made sure that I had my list of deadlines and worked on whatever I felt like working on that day, putting more emphasis on submissions that were nearing their deadlines. It was a waste of time to fret about valuing one application over another, so I put my full effort into one at a time. That strategy worked out well for me.",
interview,R_1n7yKngQkJldae0,"after babysitting a very difficult child for roughly 3 weeks, she started opening up to me and we really bonded. I understood her in a different way, and we ended up having a great relationship and I am still very close with her to this day ",
interview,R_33ptwHO1V57fKib,"I had a coworker who was lying to my boss about not doing my job. I told the boss that I was in fact doing my job, and the other person's who was telling on me and showed them proof.",
interview,R_1OGGOwqhwwf9kxA,"A child on the team I coached was having a meltdown. She could not get out of her mood, and nobody knew what to do. I talked to her, and tried to understand her situation. After listening and understanding what she needed, we were able to help her.",
interview,R_2dm3luL8JkiSA38,"A scenario that showcases how I balance teamwork and individual responsibilities is in my engineering group work when I contribute to team meetings but then work individually on my portions of the projects. In my engineering class, I have a group that I am assigned to where we all work on the tasks together. That said, we divide and conquer to complete the work in an efficient manner. With that being said, I contribute to the team when it comes to dividing the work and supporting others in their efforts to contribute to the team. However, when it comes time for me to complete work on the project myself, I take that as an individual responsibility that merely benefits the team. ",
interview,R_xckjKVnwGR37he1,"When motivating my team, I strive to utilize each member's strengths and then praise their efforts. In the past, I have used these strategies with many projects. I first assess strengths and weaknesses and make sure each person is using their strengths and avoiding what they are weak at. When they then do well, I make sure to praise their efforts with earnest congratulations and possibly treat them to lunch or give them some other extrinsic reward. Another thing to recognize with your teammates is what motivates each one and make sure that they get whatever that motivating thing is. ",
interview,R_3hbBg1v1fkpAaiw,"I felt taken for granted by my team members, due to the fact I was doing most of the ""dirty"" work like the trash, the cleaning, and the dishes. I addressed my concerns while reflecting on my actions that have led to this situation that was created. I realized I kept offering to take on these duties, and eventually, it just became what was expected. I brought up these concerns while also bringing up possible solutions. We then resolved the issue by enforcing a rotating schedule of who does what work that day. ",
interview,R_urYwGF4MnDqV5rH,I faced a tough decision when trying to decide what I wanted to do with my career and choosing the correct path. This is a problem I am currently facing and am slowing coming to a conclusion by talking to people and hands-on involvement. Gaining perspective and experience is key to forming your own opinions. ,
interview,R_2tA0VhpS4UuFkWX,"prioritizing tasks when everything seems very important can be very overwhelming. First try to talk to others to see which task is more important. If talking to others is not available, think to yourself which task is more important to the company. Try not to procrastinate any of the work because of the overwhelming nature. Do not sort the tasks by the amount of time each one takes to complete but by which you find to be most important to your job and to your company. ",
interview,R_AsTDzFQoAZsfXAR,I was offered a position on a national volleyball team but was struggling to balance my life without it at the time. I had to decide if it was smart to add something else to my plate. I came to the decision that I was already stretched too thin and would not be able to continue to give the same energy in all areas of my life if I took on a new responsibility of such caliber. This decision ended up being best for me because it game me the time to improve in all aspects of my life.,
interview,R_1ISH8gZnqFuvQLs,"There are several steps that need to be taken into consideration when developing a new project. You need to think about what's the research question, what are your intentions, missions and goals, did you do a couple of experiments/ trials that would prove the project effectiveness, did you calculate benefits vs risks, did you consider any limitations or space of improvement, did you consult between other team members involved in the same environment as you if they believe this project might bring a positive impact or wouldn't really cause change, etc.",
interview,R_z5SR44klpQW7Gdb,"I would define the purpose and objective of the project and its requirements. Then, I would gather initial information about the project. Next, I would write out all of the requirements and make sure they are accounted for. Then, I would establish change. Lastly, I would finalize everything and make sure the project's requirements are taken care of.",
interview,R_zcHoGpKN7cbybRv,"I once was offered a leadership position in my sorority very last minute. I had to plan one of the most important weekends for the new members in less than a week. This process normally takes months, and I only had days. Pushing aside unimportant tasks, such as hobbies and leisure time, and asking for help allowed me to plan everything necessary. Writing all of it down in my planner was extremely helpful and laid it all out so I could visualize what was going on. Recalibration of my tasks occurred as I was squeezing the events in my calendar. It was slightly difficult, but I completed it very efficiently.  ",
interview,R_qXyFdcK3llsiNTr,"When doing a project, I did not realize how hard it would be to complete the project by the deadline. I had started the project not very far in advance. I did not think I would get the project done in time. I got the project done in time by putting all distractions away and working for several hours straight. It was difficult but productive. ",
interview,R_6zopXRoKqrz7g8V,"One time I missed the deadline on a very important homework assignment, so I went up to my teacher and said I forgot to do it. We talked and I simply asked if there was any way I could turn it in late and that this would never happen again, as it was a simple mistake. She gave me until the end of that day to finish, but some points would be deducted. I was very happy with that decision, as not every experience allows you to get a second chance. I did it as soon as I could, and still ended with a 90 on the assignment, which included the deducted points.",
interview,R_3FVEeFj7S1bblAc,"After missing an important deadline for a school project, I was upset. However, I decided I had to accept it. I had to accept the fact that I was not going to get credit for it. I decided to work extra hard on the next assignments I had. In the end, the assignment did not take a hard toll on my grade, and I learned from the mistake.",
interview,R_1HkpqpQqxZOCxXI,"I once had to make a decision on which product to give to our higher ups. It was hard because both seemed like good options, but I found that removing any personal biases to the best of my ability and focusing on concrete pros and cons was how to best arrive at the proper conclusion. ",
interview,R_3gYmfB3uUU2jZII,"When I worked at a restaurant, I had to deal with difficult customers all the time. At one particular restaurant I worked at I stepped up as lead hostess and handled all of the upset customers. I would make sure to always listen to what they were saying and sympathize with them while also trying to calm them down if they were very angry. When someone is upset, all they want is to be heard so that was my number one priority and I would do my best to resolve the issue at hand.",
interview,R_3lPlANDvTBm99zb,"One time I had a disagreement with a supervisor, I was nervous to bring it up to my supervisor because I did not want to overstep. Thankfully, I did bring it up because it helped a lot of other employees and brought awareness to my supervisor. The situation that I will not name was resolved by both me and my supervisor finally after he saw the impact and risk that it had. I feel as though communication is another key role within any workforce.",
interview,R_2v6ur02ifNlAeqS,"When I was working in fast food, I faced a few ethical dilemmas. One notable one was when a customer began to ask for free items and became hostile with me. Instead of giving into their demands or becoming hostile with them, I simply just went to go get my manager. My manager talked with the customer for a while and eventually the situation died down and the customer left. In doing this, I was able to avoid a confrontation with the customer and not infringe on the restaurant's policies.",
interview,R_2dmDpU7IwoTYDxd,"I once had a disagreement with an instructor at a camp I volunteered at in which I thought an outfit a camper had on was perfectly appropriate for a summer camp while she thought it was too revealing. She let the camper's parents know to not put her in that outfit again and I did not vocalize my opinion on the outfit. Another instructor vocalized that the outfit was perfectly acceptable and the two agreed to disagree. The following year, the camp's dress code was no longer enforced because of complaints the following year from instructors and parents. It was not my place to complain about this and I am glad I didn't vocalize my opinion because those involved invoked that right on their own. ",
interview,R_em46x1RT7t0aJPz,"As a project manager I was tasked with revamping a company's outdated workflow system. However, the current processes involve multiple departments and intricate dependencies. To tackle this, I conducted a comprehensive analysis, identifying pain points and potential bottlenecks. Then, I collaborated with department heads and IT specialists to brainstorm innovative solutions, considering both short-term gains and long-term scales. Implementing a phased approach, I monitored progress closely, fine-tuning strategies based on feedback, ultimately ensuring a successful resolution to the intricate problem.",
interview,R_12Rzdj0O2C5wChz,My task was interrupted when I was in a zoom call giving a presentation and my child came in screaming. I dealt with my child and continued on with the zoom call. I fix the situation and move on. ,
interview,R_2wbICAMY6Zc09yL,"When faced with a complex problem at work, I broke the problem down into several steps and took a step back to view each step with empathy. I then changed the circumstances leading to the problem, and worked to make each step fair and equitable for all those involved.",
interview,R_2xDJNACyXmFi63r,"I make sure to structure my day to be optimally organized by making a mental list of the things I need to get done before the end of the day. For example last Friday I went out of town in the afternoon, so before I left I made to make a list in my head of the things I needed to get down before I leave such as schoolwork, packing, going to the gym, and showering. In terms of workspace, I make sure to structure it to be in an environment that I can accomplish things. Essentially I make sure that my desk is clean and also the environment around has all the different things I need to be able to work. I try to make sure to communicate with myself and set up my workplaces on being organized and making sure to accomplish the tasks that I have for that particular day.",
interview,R_2vffOvzLif3CdOy,"When thinking about success, I think about where I have come from, where I currently am, and where I would like to end up. In high school, I struggled severely with mental illness and had poor class attendance. I decided to take a gap year after high school, before attending university, to better myself. I am now thriving as a first semester freshman, pursuing psychology, and am doing well in my classes.I hope to become a therapist to help teenagers like I was. Success to me is about growth , and taking the steps to achieve a goal. Once I have achieved the goal, success to me is acknowledging my pride in myself.",
interview,R_3p9od6QVfnHiRUW,"My commitment to continuous professional growth was best exhibited with my experience as a dancer. After classes, I would regularly converse with my instructors and inquire about what I could improve upon. While this was extremely helpful to me as a dancer, it truly helped with my ability to network and to grow professionally. I ended up designing costumes for the same choreographers that I was dancing for at times, and this is because of the rapport I was able to establish in the short conversations after class time. ",
interview,R_popgycNea2DYgH7,I struggled to decide which college I should attend. I had to then remind myself that I needed to go to the college that felt right for me. Not the college that others would view as more prestigious. I then thought very deeply about where I felt the most at home on campus and I then arrived at my decision ,
interview,R_3PzZs7BAjwbkgNM,"At my last job, I had a short interaction with a customer. My co-worker politely pulled me aside and explained how I could've been more friendly and helpful toward the consumer by saying a few more things. I asked questions and gathered a solution. I later implemented his strategy with a new customer. It turned out to be beneficial to both me and the customer, provoking conversation and making it easier for the customer to shop with us.",
interview,R_3EEze3An1X18RFA,"I had conflicting instructions when I had two teachers teaching one class, They both gave us different assignments. I did both assignments. ",
interview,R_1JViNXGxCT9xzE9,"When taking on group projects, I focus on in-class group work, while also taking on responsibility at home. For a class presentation, we organize information and format slides in person, but fill in and answer information at home individually, checking over each others work before presenting.",
interview,R_24ra0jtLzvqaTbq,"As a high school diplomat, the presentation we were making in front of the whole program and staff was paramount.

interview,R_2B2QPhHW0yDQuMZ,An impactful team project was my senior year prom. I was in the covid 19 graduation class. So having the ability to communicate virtually from the start was a challenge we had to overcome. We wanted to make prom safe and still enjoyable for the graduating class. I would schedule meetings and ran the committee by delegating and keeping spirits up. ,
interview,R_3Hk26IxxL9ePJIo,"I think success is all about perspective. When I got into Virginia Tech that felt like success. It was my dream school back in middle school but I always doubted my ability to get in because my brother didn't. He has always been the smart one so I felt like my chances were slim. I was discouraged because I didn't get into other schools, that on paper were ""easier"" to get into. ",
interview,R_2xzKCXBzViAVyFI,"In my junior year of high school, I was given my first real leadership role in an organization. I was vice president of the organization and thus, was required to serve the president in any way that I could. As this was a new role, I was the first person to really define what that role was. I took an active role in the organization and was always in constant communication with different groups and members to be the most open and effective I could be. I think my action to really define the role has led to the future success of the organization because it defined what the role was to be which helps to create an effective future president, as that is the second stage of having this role. ",
