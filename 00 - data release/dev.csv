interview,R_1SONLQw1Nbpff7r,"Success is finally succeeding after trying and failing multiple times. For example, when I was looking for my first job, I applied about five different places and either got denied or never got a response at all. But I kept applying and trying, and eventually I ended up with a job that I loved. Success was the feeling I felt when I finally got the email saying that I had been accepted for a job after so long of working for it."
interview,R_1pzbRz5KyoceciS,"I am extremely coachable, and I am determined to deepen my understandings in the workplace. Throughout my last job, I learned new ways to handle problems through many different people. Even though I had been there for years, I was still willing to take advice from those around me. I would go through training sessions to further my understandings. "
interview,R_3Rlo4gz2kUdVEiz,During Neuroscince we have to make a project talking about a study and we all had to talk for around 2 minutes so we all dived and conqured as well as helping each other out.
interview,R_2wcPrwGq4Ml8xh1,"When I worked at a pet kennel, I was bitten by a dog that I was attempting to take out for a walk. I stepped back from the dog, remaining level headed, and went to my supervisor about the issue. I showed a maturity in my environment, and sympathized with the animal, which was afraid in its new environment away from home. Later I was able to take the animal out for a walk, and approached it slowly with treats. I took the situation as a learning experience, and applied this method to future animals that appeared fearful."
interview,R_3ERsFFBLBsjejrU,"I was a part of a Creative Problem Solving team for an future health professionals academic team. My team and I had luckily made it past the first round and were about to go to the second (last) round. The second round was a lot harder because it required us to make an entire presentation in thirty minutes. My team and I were up against forty other teams from across the country, and my team members were worried we would not do well since we had never done anything like this before. However, I convinced my team that we deserved to be there for how hard we worked. I instilled confidence in my team that we would win."
interview,R_YRhz1h1Djrv9Txv,"When I work at Banquet Serving at the Inn, I have a lot of customers complain or ask many questions. One time a woman asked me to fix the technology to get the microphone working but I do not work in that department. I decided to ask help from upper management but no one was around. I then found a walkie talkie and dialed IT to help solve the problem. The women was satisfied. "
interview,R_1nSJ3qEqXDJPvLV,I am a part of the marching band at VT and one thing I always believe in is a good attitude. Whenever things get rough I make sure I am still giving off great vibes that make everyone want to be there and push through no matter how knit picky the band directors are being.
interview,R_2VEpb7mzOIyE1kB,"One time at work, I had to cut flowers outside, but it was too cold to do so. This was an ethical dilemma because we had to be outside even though it was not considered safe working conditions. I addressed the issue by talking to my boss. This ultimately led to us being able to work inside."
interview,R_3DoUVsB929swino,"In high school, I was a ""wildcat ambassador"" which is a group of students who help to create fundraising events for different charities and help out with events around the school. Last year, we were hosting a kickball tournament to raise money for veterans in need. So we broke into groups each planning a different part. My group was in charge of advertising, I quickly suggested that we should make posters and flyers and get them on schools morning news as well as the Facebook page of our local news outlet. Everyone was ecstatic and began to carry out my plan on how to create a proper turn out for the men and women who helped to serve our country. "
interview,R_24vfl86iIHBzlM0,"One time when I was delivering fuel for my military unit, we only sent one tanker. The official overseeing the operation for the requesting unit claimed that he ordered two tankers of fuel, and he wanted me to drive to the fuel point and refill. I assured him that he only ordered one tank, and I showed him the dispatch ticket. I told him that I was not authorized to fill up a second time, and I referred him to my platoon commander. "
interview,R_12tK9E2FU1SZoTN,"Growing up, I was always taught to use SMART goals as an outline for setting effective and attainable goals. I use this in my day-to-day life to create short-term and long-term goals. I am a very determined and motivated person so I don't have too much of an issue achieving these."
interview,R_2aFF1TlyzwD6l2l,"While in my senior year of high school, I decided to take AP Calculus to challenge myself academically. The first semester was very challenging and it was the first time I had every failed a test in a high school and AP class. I would attend extra help but I took it upon myself to finally seek a tutor for an outside perspective. After months with the tutor and trial and error, I ended with a high grade and personal success after overcoming the challenge."
interview,R_1n0ZZajo6oMDViH,"A story where I proactively took the lead is when in my job I was chosen to carry out payroll, making the full employee pay period schedule, and communicate with all employees about both of these tasks in a single shift. While this was a difficult task, getting it done in this concise manner proved to be the most successful and efficient and was continuously used in the workplace. "
interview,R_29vqY6n1IRZyKpI,"I worked in a team where one of the group members did not do the work. Therefore, I confronted my group members and we talked him but nothing changed. Therefore, we went to the professor. The professor took over the situation, but the group continued to do their parts of the project. He then apologized for his behavior. This made the group more cohesive to finish. "
interview,R_2dn1oIus1b9yRyy,"The process I do when delegating tasks to other people is to see who's great at a certain thing. Making sure that their work meets my type of quality. For example, in my business fraternity, we have to work with a company and improve their quality of work. In this project, I'm apart of the website design. So we divided the work by making sure who ever is great at one thing will do that work. "
interview,R_2ZQZtxFXdzX8Agg,"As a first-generation American and college student, success to me is equivalent to drive. I think it is very important to work as hard as you can to ensure a good future for yourself. In high school, I did my best to be a well-rounded and interesting college applicant. In the end, I was able to utilize my experiences as a student and also outside of that to get scholarships, which made it possible for me to afford college."
interview,R_eYgzNHZxTefjylb,"One moment when I was faced with a tough decision was when deciding what college to attend.  I was between VT and Drexel, and I weighed the pros and cons of each school.  I also looked at how each school was overall, and for my specific major.  Another factor was social life and distance."
interview,R_2ciHp5vtMBlzoMM,"During a time when I felt overwhelmed at work, I decided to take a step back and do a calming activity. I came back after a short break when I didn't think about the problem, made a plan, and then started working."
interview,R_xlap2BY21H9jrSF,I participated in a group project that found a way to limit carbon emissions into the atmosphere from vehicles.

I told my team we may have a lead and they shifted their focus to my experimental groups I was testing. 
interview,R_2DNxQ9botV7B3gt,"During school, I usually have each week multiple projects/ assignments at once that have the same due dates. In these instances I prioritize the work that will need the most attention and time to complete will be started first and so on. I also set specific times each day to work on each specific assignment so they get the needed attention and plan to always have them done in advance of the due dates in case it needs more time to be finished. "
interview,R_D1t1436D21k1KMh,"More than failure is repeated failure. My father taught me how to play chess from a young age. What was different from his approach to teaching than most is that he never let me win nor go easy on me. Any time we played I had to go in trying my hardest, just to know that I would likely lose. Nowadays I have learned to think far ahead; I beat him almost every time now."
interview,R_1JRBCJkrABFZodx,"It is difficult to get criticism but some people are just trying to help. I am a photographer and when I first started out, I would get feedback on my photos and people would tell me everything I was doing wrong. It was a struggle to understand they weren't being mean they just wanted to see me improve."
interview,R_30jDmYk3W97gaN6,Ensuring that it is a judgement-free zone and that you care about your employees is extremely important in creating an environment of openness and trust. 
interview,R_3G2O69oOEvqQLuM,"Certainly, I'd be happy to share a personal story that encapsulates my view of success. A few years ago, I took on a leadership role in a community volunteer project. We aimed to build a playground for underprivileged children, and the task seemed daunting. The journey was filled with challenges, including fundraising obstacles and coordinating volunteers. Despite the adversity, we persevered, and the day we unveiled the completed playground to those joyful children was an incredibly defining moment for me. Success, to me, is not just about personal achievement, but it's about making a positive impact on the lives of others through determination, teamwork, and resilience, and that experience embodies my perception of success."
interview,R_12DWDAkJbid4eoJ,"My approach to optimizing my day and workspace revolves around strategic planning. Mornings kick off with a review of my goals, using a planner to chart out tasks and deadlines. I make a conscious effort to prioritize assignments aligning with my career aspirations. To maintain focus, I allocate specific time blocks for studying, attending classes, and engaging in extracurriculars.

My workspace is organized and clutter-free, providing a conducive environment for concentration. Throughout the day, breaks are strategically incorporated to prevent burnout. An anecdote that exemplifies my methods involves successfully leading a group project, where effective time management and organizational skills played a pivotal role. This structured routine not only enhances academic performance but also contributes to a well-rounded college experience."
interview,R_Uijd1cAw6s8mu9b,"I was faced with a tough decision when deciding to quit my last job. I had never quit anything in my life before. I ultimately weighed my pros and cons and eventually turned in my two weeks notice. Since the bosses were abusive I allowed myself to quit for the first time ever. It was hard to do, but ultimately best for me."
interview,R_3NPxZywPrqbdJQD,"Whenever there is a heavy situation that occurs, the first thing I do is take a deep breath. Easy enough, this reminds myself that breathing is such a simple thing everyone does and it is the base line for all of us, everyone has to breath right ? In a way it grounds me and proves that no matter what the situation is there will be a solution even if it is not what I necessarily want."
interview,R_3WqlJhJXvwCLkgF,"Last year I had the opportunity of studying abroad in Rwanda Africa. My team had to come up with a grant proposal that could be used within the community. We all had brilliant ideas, but we ultimately ended up going with mine. I was able to come up with an idea based off of my own experiences as well as my families. As a team we came up with a plan to implement that plan."
interview,R_3qDp4AzytKP3OIL,"I had a group project this past semester, and I thought I had a great group. We had an assignment to do, and I showed up to class and no one else did. This was a challenge, because it left me to complete the assignment on my own and also make decisions for the whole group. I ended up having a kind conversation with them, explaining that we need to do things as a team and they were very receptive to that, however I did not want to have that conversation. "
interview,R_3Oom8tJM94PTm0a,"At my current job with the Virginia Tech Women's Center, it is imperative to have high quality work in everything we do. It's crucial to provide our clients with quality information, resources, and advocacy services. The quality is the most paramount factor. To create clear and concise content, it's important to provide high quality work. "
interview,R_1ruiU7CwYGu3axm,"To set a good goal is to have an expectation for yourself that is both measurable and achievable. A lot of the time, this means that you need to set a quantifiable goal that you can look back on and say you achieved. However, these goals also can't be too small that they don't give you anything to strive for. The first example that comes to my head is when I was playing kicker for my school's football team. The goal that I set for myself at the start of the season was to go 95% on field goals. Not only was this an achievable goal, but I could also look back at the end of the season and determine if I had met it or if I hadn't."
interview,R_3GpngR75wVLmBoi,"When I worked as a teacher at an English academy is South Korea, I had to stand up for my ideas. My ideas had to do with how we talk and communicate with the parents. I recommended other teachers to be more polite and friendly to the parents and my boss really appreciated since I spoke up for her. "
interview,R_1oGUVLefB61LXhy,"There have been many times where I have been told conflicting instructions. One in particular was when I had a shift manager tell me to do something one way and then the general manager told me to do the same thing in another way. Although both individuals are higher than me, the general manager is higher than the shift manager. Because of this I listened to my general manager's instructions. I then explained the situation to the shift manager."
interview,R_vqyjtMjpYKMIqMp,"I live in a house with 4 other girls. We all get along really well, but sometimes we have disagreements on different aspects of living together. Things like rent, rooms, cleaning, and house purchases are some of the things that we disagree on. I have taken the initiative when talking to my roommates to help us work through things and make plans. I am a natural mediator."
interview,R_eW3lv2px8o4KiRj,"Growing up my mom worked nonstop. She worked day and night and hardly took a break. She was building her career and always had a very strong work ethic. She ended up winning the CFO of the Year award and was praised for the change she made in non-profit organizations and her hard work. To me, that is what success is, working hard and never giving up to be the best you can be."
interview,R_1NtDF3lD3DWeUGf,I missed the deadline on a crucial essay. I emailed my professor and explained to him the situation taking full accountability. He eventually gave me an extension. 
interview,R_1TtDvPN7zTXcHSh,"While being the president of college mentors for kids at VT,  faced many challenges regarding working with my exec team. Team members were upset with other team members and I as president needed to resolve these issues. I found talking to each person individually and reaching out to the National Office I was able to find a compromise and understand everyone's concerns better. I think taking initiative and letting everyone have a voice I was able to manage the challenge. "
interview,R_290p01IKflstbpm,"In high school, I was a managing editor for my school's yearbook. With this position came a desired role of leadership, but I had to ensure that the staff members were satisfied with their roles as well. In order to balance teamwork, I ensured that all of their ideas were listened to and considered before the final decision was made, as that was my ultimate responsibility. However, this made it so that everyone felt included but I was still able to maintain my specific duties as managing editor to the necessary level."
interview,R_3n11bAnkV44xnOP,"When I worked as a hostess, it was frustrating to upkeep table rotations when some members of my team would ignore it, or make honest mistakes. To navigate this, I began communicating more instead of relying on our chart, and calling out which table is next. Additionally, I would check over tables that were empty more regularly than usual to reduce uncertainty. These things made the system flow easier."
interview,R_tLmqygFhuz9QBm9,A challenging experience while working with a team would be when things get stressful and people start being rude to each other. I navigate this by reminding everyone that we are on the same team and that we should all be working together. 
interview,R_eVZUzD0Z9D9qgUh,"A time that displayed balancing teamwork and individual responsibilities was being the captain of the lacrosse team. I had to ensure that teams needs were being met, while also staying on top of my tasks to help move the team forward. My team would come to me with questions and I would then go talk to the coach to come up with a solution that best represents the team. I had to hold practices and run warm ups that would benefit others around me. At times it can be hard, but keeping both myself and the team in mind help resolve conflict. "
interview,R_2fevsbi94CouakF,"I was not planning on being in charge. But when I saw the opportunity  I took it head on. I knew the team needed help and needed to be led. This resulted in less confusion and everyone on the same page. In the end, I was not appointed the lead but knew my team would benefit from it."
interview,R_1n3BVKl5N6HBMQK,"I try to approach every goal I have with my ""why"" always in thought. What I mean is when I work towards my goal I always keep the reason why I am doing it in thought. This helps me keep that motive to strive and work hard towards it. One example of this was working to getting a job at a public school system as an instructural assistant. And I keep in mind that the reason I wanted to do this is because of my love for filling children with knowledge. "
interview,R_2urOAbT2hTjXE2O,"I set small goals for myself. There is always a bigger goal in mind but having smaller goals first makes it easier to go for that larger goal. A specific goal I had was to gain more money, put more money in my bank account. So I got a better job, started to try to get more hours, and eventually I gained more money that I ever had at my old job. That is my way of pursuing goals, one step at a time."
interview,R_1l6sEecJaKh3o5L,"My approach to networking involves making a point to introduce myself and make meaningful connections within all company departments. By immersing myself in all departments and treating everyone with respect and kindness, deeper connections can be formed with employees with a richer work history than I do. Occasionally, my coworkers will connect me with their previous employers, expanding my professional playing field. In addition, I remain active on LinkedIn. I also heavily interact with the customers, which are usually large-scale power companies, of my company."
interview,R_SViudoeEcuc4Xfj,"One time when I was doing something to what I thought was the best of my ability, I was told my work could have looked better. I was confused, because I thought I had put a lot of effort into it. However, I realized that our views on the quality of work may look a little bit different. I asked how I could improve for next time. I worked to fulfill those qualities instead, and improved my work. "
interview,R_d0Z3zPFGQDG4Ntn,"An ethical dilemma I have faced is seeing someone who is facing financial problems stay clocked in when they should not be to get a little extra money. I was faced with either looking the other way of turning them into our boss. It was a difficult decision because I knew they were struggling, but also my job could be compromised if they found out I knew this was going on. I ended up talking to the person and convinced them to stop doing it before it caused more problems."
interview,R_2WuqY3AJT6IeafG,"One time I had received a grade on my math test i hadn't agreed with, especially since i had done the work correctly and thoroughly. I approached my supervisor and explained how i believed I deserved full marks because I had correctly solved the problem, even if it wasn't the same way they had solved it. I argued that because they hadn't clarified what method they wanted to be used to solve the question, it was fair that i used the one i thought fit. They agreed and gave me the marks. "
interview,R_eJyFlKWNEA6KEc9,"When I receive constructive criticism, I am given good information first. They tend to make me feel like I didn't do anything wrong but there was something I could fix. I then proceeded with any questions about the situation and fixed the action they recommended. "
interview,R_28BCMpCBm5uIy69,"Last year I was the dance captain of my team. In this role I taught the choreography and worked to perfect it . After months of work with my co- dance captain we ended up winning 3 times that year. On top of learning how to lead , I still had a healthy mindset and built amazing bonds with new people. I will be forever grateful to have been able to hold that role ."
interview,R_3HFY9VTgJawTiWU,First i will see the description of the project. Then i will see if there are toehrs involved and how to split up the work. Then i will see which parts are quickest and which are most time consuming. Then i will start working. I wiill keep working and keeping those in mind until i complete it.
interview,R_3JIQFOZOiPVDSCT,"My perception of success through a personal story would be getting through high school with a 4.1 GPA. As I grew up and moved around a lot I missed out on so many key moments of my childhood but also some really important learning periods. So going to school there were a lot of holes in my education and I was usually put into the classes that were ""normal"" more in a more realistic book ""people that need a little more help and guidance"".  I never thought much of it until I moved to Virginia and was put into a public school that was not on a base where only military children attended. It was a slap in the face of reality and It made me focus more on school so that I could be put in the advanced classes. After some time I did it, I was placed in more advanced classes, and by the time I got into high school, I was focusing more on the grades part of school. I pushed myself to get really good grades because I wanted to prove that I could do it to myself, that I could get above a 4.0 GPA. I was successful. I had done it and was proud.  "
interview,R_3gZ2netxFJSqg1P,"I had to determine how to punish a coworker for showing up late to work. This worker was my friend, but he was late to work. If my boss found out I would have gotten in trouble. In the end I weighed my outcomes and overall value of the job. I decided to do the right thing and tell my boss resulting in slight punishment for my coworker."
interview,R_3j6bDCzZENanzlA,I ask follow up questions to ensure accountability as well as checking with supervisors. 
interview,R_3staq8NBFGWC23P,"This semester in my sorority, I stepped up to the New Member Educator for my sorority, to step up and led our New Member class to teach them the history, and traditions, and also act as a mentor to them in their new member process, which can be considered a more stressful for them."
interview,R_2TT4H3Jq7yqlaQF,"For workplace organization I make sure that I have what I need to do for the upcoming weeks written down in my calendar at all times. Writing my plans and work in my calendar help me stay up to date on all of my work and deadlines that I need to meet. Aside from the calendar I have all of my work organized in different folders, and label them, so that I know where everything is at all times. This helps me stay organized and focused so I know what needs to get done."
interview,R_yyGvWg1rJloYdiN,"I juggled between multiple projects in school before. The main strategy I used was to allow myself enough time to work on each project. I spent one hour on a math project, another hour on a history project, and then another hour on science. I would take breaks between projects to make sure my brain was functioning for each project. Breaks really help to restore the brain."
interview,R_3RapqGBKGcuoCdv,"I have always liked wroking in a group. I think it is really important to have imput from everyone in the group, so I always make sure that everyone is able to say what they think is important. For example, eveyone in the group gets a certain time to talk and then we can from an answer together. That is how we at least used to do it in school."
interview,R_3HjfOjaqJ1WMNiO,I was social outreach for a global ambassadors club in high school. I helped market the upcoming foreign exchange students arrival and therefore made the event bigger and more successful.
interview,R_W9im3mpYOoAG1Bn,"An ethical dilemma that I faced at work was to sacrifice my job becasue of a customer being rude to my fellow employee who was being screamed at, or allow my coworker to continue to be reprimanded in front of the entire store. Not only did I stick up for what I thought was right but I also did it in a very kind manner. I kindly told the woman who we had disagreements with to kindly pay for her things and leave without starting an argument and without loosing my job. My coworker thanked me for helping me stick up for her as she was a very shy girl who obviosuly didnt know how to handle herself in these situations. "
interview,R_3rZ0O8ERZSGJjg5,"At work, we had 20+ reservations last week on one night. It was my job to write them all down, but I forgot to refresh the system to ensure we were seeing all of them. My supervisor later took me aside to make sure I understood how to work the system and to make sure it didn't happen again. I thanked her for reminding me, apologized, and made sure to internalize that information so that I didn't forget again. It made me feel a little incompetent, but I will be better prepared for next time."
interview,R_2QVD5XXtbJu8PEo,A time at work when I was faced with a complex problem was when my boss did not show up and we could not get a hold of her. My coworkers and I had to assume responsibility for the role that she plays in the restaurant. We knew her positions and were able to divert the tasks and handle her absence. 
interview,R_2qmZANk1PhPDSjp,"I think the best way to motivate a team is to be honest. I make it my priority to be as straightforward as possible to reduce the possibilities of misconceptions and doubt. In my business project this year, my team was pitching their product ideas, and I gave my input for the ideas I liked as well as the ones that I didn't. This led to the selection of an excellent project in the end."
