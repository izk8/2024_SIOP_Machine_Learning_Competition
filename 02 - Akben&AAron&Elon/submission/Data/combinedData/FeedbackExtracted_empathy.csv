114,train,"Hey Jonathan! I've been in touch with Terry, I'm so glad to hear how much you are enjoying the Beta Project, I even hear you are hoping that this experience will further your ambitions toward a Lead Engineer position! However, I understand there has been some issues with your reports that Terry has brought up with you, and I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss them.1) Opinion vs. FactsYour reports contain a lot of insights about what the data means, and at times finding the specific hard facts can be difficult.2) Level of DetailYou include every bit of data that you can into your reports, which can make it difficult to take away the larger picture.I want to encourage you to take these things away for the following reasons:1) your reports are reviewed by everyone in upper management, including the CEO! The opinions you have are great, but when evaluating documents the CEO just needs to highest level, most important items. The nitty-gritty would fall to another department2) as you have a desire to move up and be a Lead Engineer, these kinds of reports will be more and more common. Keeping your thoughts organized and well documented is going to become a very important skill to have.For your next report I would like you to prepare a cover sheet that goes with the report. This cover sheet should be a single page highlighting only the key facts of the report. Your own opinions and analysis can be included, but let those who are interested read it on their own time, the high level facts are key for the meeting they will be presented in. I would also encourage you to make sure the rest of the report has clearly defined headings and topics, so it is easy to find information related to each item.

40,dev,"Hi Jonathan. First of all, thanks for helping out with the Beta project. You have helped us identify improvements that even we didnt know we needed. Now that you have become a seasoned contributor, it is time to up your game. To do that, you can work on 2 major improvement areas of your report for which I have received feedback from your team. The first is that you need to make your reports concise. I understand that you like to provide valuable insights but it becomes difficult to take the main points out of the report. What you can do is that you can keep the insights in an annexure This would keep the core of the report intact and would also enable us to go through your valuable insights.Also though your reports are filled with insights, it is important to also structure them properly so that they can be sent to the management directly without much review. It will only enable you to perform at your peak. I believe if you improve on the above 2 items, you would definitely take your performance to the next level and which would further your career growth in the years to come. I can help you in finding a mentor/ attend training programs to improve your skills. Please feel free to call/ message me for a detailed conversation or if you need my guidance.","Based on my analysis, here are the sentences or phrases from the feedback that demonstrate empathy, perspective-taking, support, and encouragement:

The first sentence shows perspective-taking by acknowledging the employee's intention to provide valuable insights, even though the execution needs improvement. The second sentence offers encouragement that improving will lead to career growth, and provides support by offering to help find a mentor or training programs.","I understand that you like to provide valuable insights but it becomes difficult to take the main points out of the report.

Of particular interest is that you had mentioned your desire to be promoted to Terry.

Specifically, creating reports that just state the facts, although we are thankful you are thinking ahead, other ideas that you might have might be better suited elsewhere outside of the reports. You would like to be promoted within a year and I want to make that happen, but in order to do so you will need to be receptive to feedback and improve your business reports.

122,dev,"Hello Jonathan, I am writing in regards to the technical reports that you submit using the information you are collecting.  Your reports are extremely detailed and provide all of the data needed to make decisions, and your insights and conclusions are well thought out.  However, as these are technical reports, it is always a good idea to separate the facts and data from personal conclusions, to allow others to draw their own conclusions from the information provided.  From what I've heard, there is a lot to be gained from your experience and first hand knowledge.  I would suggest that you include your comments and ideas in a separate appendix to your report.  This would allow reviewers to gain the main points of the report, but also allow them the opportunity review your conclusions on the data.  Also, providing a more concise report allows others to draw their own conclusions, and they are then able to contact you, personally, if they would like more information on the subject. I know that business writing can be a daunting task, and we've all had to learn ways to get our thoughts down in a way that is both professional and easily understood.  I know I have!  If you would like, we can enroll you in some courses in writing, or I'd be happy to review your reports before submission.  Just let me know. Thank you for your continued contributions!

93,dev,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing good! Understand that you are quite happy with the Beta Project and gaining a lot of experience out of it. This is really an exciting opportunity for you.Keeping in mind the opportunity comes a bit of responsibility also. Considering the reports that you are sending, it's really good to know that you are giving enough insights in form of commentary along with the technical information. You have done a really good job as far as technical information is concerned, on the other hand one should have an understanding about what exactly the reader of the report wants. In this case they would only want to see the technical information rather than along with your perspectives on the report. Suggest you to concentrate on the technical findings only as this will result in less time spend for the end user to search for the facts and thus will meet the deadlines which I believe has been a struggle in the recent past. I suggest you to just have a quick 10 mins call with me just before submitting the report so that we are on the same page and figure out if the facts are clearly visible.Since you are gaining on experience, I would suggest you to undergo trainings on business writing. By doing so you will understand how to convey your message in a short and crisp way. This will not only save time for yourself and your counter part but will also help you to communicate exactly what you want to.I will suggest your name for the upcoming training and you can participate to change for the better.This is in line with the feedback I received as they are quite happy with the technical facts still there are some areas of improvement.

I heard that you have been working with Terry recently on the Beta project and have been busy traveling to gathering information for your technical reports. I have also read some of the reports that you have submitted, and I'm surprised how much information you can gather within such short periods of time and there also some good suggestions to help the team improve! However, sometimes too much information might be overwhelming for the reader as well. Here are some suggestions that can consider when writing your next report. Try to summarize your report and focus on technical information first. You can separately draft your opinions and recommendations in another report to be submitted to Terry. Your reports also have to be reviewed by other team members, so do take note on the timeline and give sufficient time to the rest so that we can achieve the timeline as a team. I have also attached some great technical reports here, hope they would help with your upcoming technical reports and Terry would also be able to provide further training if necessary.

55,dev,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are well?It has been brought to my attention that we are having issues with the technical report writing on the Beta Project, which I am hoping you can help correct and resolve? There are two main issues as shown below: Additional Commentary which are opinion based and not necessarily just focused on the facts. This makes the reports very difficult to digest and summarize.Lack of organization which requires additional re-work before being passed onto the CEO or prospective customer. In order to improve this, I will ask Terry to provide you with additional feedback which I am requesting you take on board for the future report writing. There are several reports coming up and if we make these changes now, it will help the team meeting the deadlines moving forward.If you feel like you need additional training on report writing please let me know? Please take this as positive feedback and continue with your enthusiasm on the Beta Project. Kind Regards William","Here is my analysis of the empathetic feedback in the given text:

This  is great to hear - keep up the good work! Terry and I also discussed the reports that a being generated and it was mentioned that they are proving quite time consuming. Have you considered reviewing the content of these to ensure only the information that is required is being documented? It's great to see how excited you are about learning during this project. However, we need to consider the information that is included in the reports and consider the audience in that they are intended for. As the reports are for our customers or Exec board, I would like you to consider what factual information they require and the purpose of sharing this information. As these reports are required for critical decision making, we require the reports to be fact based and concise to ensure relevant information is readily available. If it would help, I can share some examples of this? Furthermore, we can enquire about a training in this area if you feel you would be of benefit to this? Your insight is extremely valuable to us so let's understand how we can best share this information with the wider team, separate to the reports that are being to ensure that they are used for the intended purpose of providing insight.

I want to bring out few points to get more impact on findings you do. Hence my suggestion for you would be following. Once you create the reports, I would like you to go through two three times to look at ares where you can bring in refinement, so that it is crisp and concise. As you know our customers and senior leaderships would love to get most important points/snippets when they read reports. Hence it is important that we give them concise reports which will create first impression and hit on the important points.I think if you can do this, you will improve your research quality and report quality, and bring in a new dimension to your overall skills - which is consulting. That would be an awesome skill to acquire and that would give you tremendous opportunities to grow. At the end of the day, we work to make our customers happy and if our customers are happy with quality of the content we provide, we as a team grow exponentially. I would also suggest to work more collaboratively, seek feedbacks from seniors/peers which will only improve your work. We all come with a view, but it is ok to get another view and weigh in every option to decide the best. We all learn from each other and that make us a better person.

However, it appears your approach should be refined because your current reporting is not meeting our needs. We need to provide clear, concise, fact-based reporting every time, and at this point the team has found you resistant to changing your format to reflect this need. Others on the team have spent significant time editing your reporting to our standards, and they cannot continue to do so. I suggest you review the prior reporting and adapt your style to meet the needs of our team, i.e. we need only well organized facts that can easily be understood by our audience (remember, you're writing to the audience's needs, not your own). You're welcome to include more commentary in an email to me and the team, because we do appreciate a lot of your insights, but we do not have room for it within the report. If you cannot commit to this change now, we will recommend removing you from the project. Thank you.

I would like to help you be more valuable to the team to make sure you have a shot at that promotion you are looking for.First, please seek out a business writing course. You can contact HR to inquire about available company resources. If ABC-5 does not offer a course I would ask that you research outside sources. This will give you an opportunity to improve yourself and be more valuable to the company as a whole.Second, until you have completed that course please keep your reports fact based. Your valuable commentary and opinions can be submitted via email or as an addendum of the report, but do not include it in the reporting document. This will help the team to quickly decipher the information and be able to report up to the steering committee. this approach will help the team greatly, but also give you the opportunity to provide feedback.

I understand you are really enjoying your work with the Beta project and are excited about the findings and applications.I would firstly, like to tell you that your contributions and ideas about improvements are valued by ABC-5. They just go on to show how deeply you are involved in the whole process which is great. At ABC-5 we strive to continuously improve upon our work and the output we give and as your manager and mentor, there is some feedback that i want to give you so that you can develop and grow at ABC-5. In such high-profile projects like this one, as much as the process of gathering information , going deep into understanding whats happening is important, how the findings are presented especially to the senior leadership is equally important. It is critical that when you submit reports for the project, you clearly distinguish between the facts and what your opinions and insights are.

I have seen that you have been helping out with the Beta project for some time, and I do appreciate your effort and time that you have been invested into this. However, I do also need your attention on the following points that I think you need to improve to be more efficient with your job flow and more effectively to communicate with your colleagues. I understand the working background where you are coming from which hinders you from communicate within the organization professionally and effectively. However, I do believe that if you can specifically improve the following two things, you will go much further in your career. Try to put less of commentary in your report, because these are opinions not facts, which will create extra problems that are not necessarily healthy in the team problem solving environment. Try to improve your business writing skills that can help you be more organized and pin-point the importance of the matters that you want to state. You can use your spare time to self study online and read books regarding how to improve your written skills.I really want your attention and commitment on these two matters, because I am writing to you to make you a better fit in the organization and I hope all the best for your career advancement. It is for you but the same time also for the company, we want everyone to succeed in their career.I would like to get an update from you regarding how you would improve these two matters in the following two days, and I like to see your action plan accordingly. I will tell you in advance that I will meet up with you bi-weekly to see if you have done anything differently. There will be a three month watching time from me to see how you can improve yourself, there will be an assessment towards the end of this.

In order for the readers of your reports to gather all the relevant information quickly and efficiently, your reports need to be more concise. Since everyone, including yourself, is very busy, the reports only should contain the relevant technical information. You may provide some additional commentary if asked by the reader. This will streamline our processes and ensure a smooth transfer of data. I would like for you to review some reports of Alex to see examples of how they should be completed. I have informed Alex of this and he should be setting up a meeting to go over any questions you may have. We can also arrange for you to attend an outside writing course at a local university if that interests you.

Your reports are starting to get wider circulation and are critical to meeting or exceeding the sales targets.

<response>
[No empathetic feedback found]
</response>

The feedback is focused solely on critiquing the employee's writing style and report quality. While it does mention trying to ""polish"" the employee's writing in the future, this is framed more as a directive rather than an empathetic offer of support. The line ""Don't feel this mail as an attack but as a way to improve and reach in a near future your desired promotion"" comes across as an attempt to soften the criticism rather than a genuine expression of empathy or encouragement.

Overall, the feedback lacks perspective-taking statements that show the writer is considering the employee's point of view or emotional state. It is direct criticism without empathetic language or sentiment.",This feedback does not contain any empathetic feedback.,0

This will be a golden opportunity to prove your prowess in providing factual information which are relevant among the vast amount of information you collect and thus help you in a faster career progression.
Kindly let me know if you would like to connect with me or if we can help you in any training or courses in written communication and concise analysis.
Hope you will take my feedback constructively.",0

I have received very good feedback about your contributions to the Beta project. Congratulations!Jonathan, along with all the good things I heard about you, there is a concern that has come up. This is regarding the reports that you have been submitting. Your reports seem to have too many details and are poorly organized. I understand that you try to share your insights on the Beta project through these reports. However, it would really bring out your best work if you keep your reports restricted to only the technical information and more concise. Would you like some help to hone your business writing skills? If yes, please reach out to HR for access to business writing courses or trainings. Do set up some time with Terry for him to take you through some reports he has drafted. I would also recommend you to read some of your reports that Terry has edited before sending to our prospective customers or ABC-5's CEO. I'm sure you understand that as important as it is to do a good job, it is also important to be able to draft reports that help others get to the most important facts quickly and in the best way possible.  Here is another idea. Would you consider having verbal discussions or virtual meetings with the team to share the information that you consider really valuable to the team? I am sure the team would love to learn from the unique insights and perspectives that you have on the Beta project. Let me know what you think. In case you need any support from me or if there is any way I can help you with this, please do let me know. I really appreciate all the hard work that you have put in for this project.

I can see that you have been quite involved with the Beta project and been contributing to a great extent with your reports. There is some feedback that I have received and would like to discuss the same with you.The reports that you have submitted seem to have a mix of facts, surrounding details and your opinions put together in a slightly disarrayed manner. This would mean that the reports become unnecessarily lengthy and probably difficult to grasp. Your reports are very critical to the project and it is important that we keep these reports to the point and completely fact-based, to save the group's time and effort to decipher the report. I hope you understand the important role that you have to continue playing and to ensure your reports serve their purpose to the greatest extent. To support you in this endeavour to more concise report writing, I shall request Mary to share some writing tips with you.

156,test,"Hi Jonathan. I hope this note finds you well! I'm reaching out to discuss the great work you've been doing on the Beta project. As you know, this project is both crucial and time-sensitive (which is the same case as many other projects). I've had a chance to review some of your reports. It's obvious you're super passionate and engaged n the work, and have a hunger to share not only the facts, but also your POV. While this is great, when we're sending out reports to leadership, we have to make sure we're being mindful of their busy schedules/competing priorities. I think we have a chance to help streamline your comms so they're super easy to digest and don't require many rounds of revision before going out the door. I've included a couple best-in-class examples of reports, for you to review. I'd like you to familiarize yourself with this format, taking note of the content included - and not included. You'll note that they just have the facts, not commentary. A hunger to showcase your curiosity and insights is great, but these comms must only include facts. There are other forums we can create to ensure your passion isn't being kept at bay, but we need the reports to be really tight. As a next steps, please shoot me a copy of your next report, using this template. From there, I'll provide some quick notes to help ensure we're modeling the template and setting up the comms in a tighter way for leadership. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Look forward to seeing the updated template from you. Keep up the good work!

I would like to discuss 2 ways which will continue to lead to a positive experience in your contribution. The first is around how to help you efficiently capture your commentary, which in turn will help save you time.  We are all very busy, including yourself so the more concise our commentary, the increased likelihood of our colleagues understanding the information.   The second is helping you create your messages in an cohesive manner, which will help them be easy to read and understand.  This will also help your commentary to be consistent with your colleagues, which will ensure better understanding from customers, as well as internal stakeholders.I would like to partner you up with a tenured employee, Molly, to review how she compiles her commentary in reports.  Upon completion please send over any key learning and how you will incorporate the leanings in your reports. Again thank you for all you do.

It will be a win-win for both of us.This will also ensure your are not only technically knowledgeable but also good in writing which will help you to move up the career.Once I am back, let's see the progress.

Looks like you are enjoying the work and are enthusiastic about it. What is equally important is to ensure that others are equally excited about your work too. I have received feedback that your reports are turning too verbose and you need improvement on your report writing skills.Jonathan.. All your hard work will go underappreciated if you are not able to put it to an efficient output that others can quickly understand and appreciate.Here are some suggestions for you:Review and edit your final product: You may want to put everything you think is important in your first draft. But once you're done, do multiple reviews and question yourself on each segment, if it is really important, can this be concise, is this repetitive. With each review, your reports will definitely improve.Stick to technical facts: While I understand the urge to provide explanations and inferences so you can provide a detailed picture. You can structure it differently. Create a main concise section with only the important points, which should be the final report. You can add additional reference section with the details for anyone who needs more information.  This will allow people who do not have the time to read the detailed reports to also get the gist.Enroll for Business Writing training program:  Get in touch with HR to help you find a suitable program. Improving these skills will help  you in long term.You are a hard working ambitious guy, and with your aspiration to be a lead engineer, it is important that you are deliverable are high quality and appreciated by team and customers.Do send a copy of your current report and the one you will create after incorporating these suggestions. This will help you put a timeline and get an outside perspective.

Terry has informed me that although you have identified some great improvements your reports are unfortunately too long with too much of commentary and the team cant really separate fact from your opinion. He says he did mention this to you before but it was not taken seriously. I see the passion in your work we just need to focus and streamline it a bit more so that you can deliver a report that is correct and eveyone can understand.I think first things first is to get you enrolled into a training program for businee/report writing to help you get the technical knowledge. i also would like to assign you a mentor that has great experience with report writing that can help you when you need it. We can also have regular check-ins to see how the progress is being made.I know with your travels it might be easeir to do the training online so maybe in the meantime start doing some research on this. Also i would really like to hear your feedback on this. You are a great associate and we all learn new skills daily as part of our development.","Based on my analysis, here are the sentences/phrases from the feedback that demonstrate empathy, perspective-taking, support, and encouragement:

I know that you are new to the team, and this is a great learning opportunity to make sure that only the facts are included in the report that are required.Ask Terry about additional ways to provide your ideas. Perhaps hold a weekly discussion to review the information and provide your colored commentary. Terry will have additional ideas that you two can discuss. Before submitting your report this week, please also ask for a peer review from one of your co-workers. This is a great opportunity for you to meet and learn additional tips and tricks from your colleagues. Please send me a note and let me know how these things go.

I'd suggest reviewing your thoughts and feelings about the facts with me in our 1-on-1's and I'm more than happy to listen! 2) Point form is your friend. I would suggest making a draft copy of your findings in point form, and then condensing that even more when you place them in order from most urgent/pressing to least. This will ensure the meatier items aren't left for last, and that the real core of the messaging is properly received.

I have collected some feedback on your technical reports and identified a few areas for improvement that will help you and the team be more successful and efficient.  While your opinions on the technical details and requirements are appreciated, in the reports we need to focus on the technical requirements that have data to support them. There are two issues with your reporting that need to be resolved immediately or someone else will take over your role on project Beta.1) The reports are rolled up to higher level executives who have limited time and need to see only the technical facts with supporting data.  Please convey your opinions and commentary on the data verbally, in person, not directly in your reports.2) Your technical background is highly regarded but your reports are difficult for higher level executives to quickly digest.  Please ask Terry for an example of one of your previous reports that he has edited and compare it to your original version.  I think you will see the differences and be able to implement the changes yourself in the future.Please let me know that you understand these issues and let me know if you have any questions.

While we value your insights on the technical points within the report, I would request you to segregate the technical findings and your insights into 2 different reports. This would help the team to easily identify the factual points and refer to your commentary for a detailed analysis
Finally you can get your report reviewed by a peer or your mentor before you submit the report.

141,test,"Good morning Jonathan, I hope you are well.  I would like to circle back with you regarding the reports that are being sent in. Unfortunately, we are not able to speak live but here are some key points to the way our reports need to be constructed as per the company’s standards. It is critical we keep to the main points for reporting to management. For example, if we add too much of our opinion it may mislead the direction or feedback given. Please ensure your reports are in the format we reviewed; bullet pointed with just the facts.You can always discuss your opinions after with Terry. Secondarily, I would recommend you scheduling a weekly conference call with Terry to work on the way we organize and construct the reports. This will further support upper managements review and understanding of data shared. Will you be able to meet these requirements?  I know you have high aspiration and professional goals to grow and look forward to supporting you getting there. These are some ofthe first steps to ensuring your future success within ABC-5. I will be checking in with Terry monthly to ensure we see improvement. Please let me know if you have questions, concerns or if this direction is not clear.

Your contributions and the improvement opportunities you have identified have been great for the growth of the project. The reason of my message today is to help you improve on the delivery of the great ideas you have shared and contributed.As you know, your reports are highly valued by a number of high- ranking managers and they are pivotal in helping the management make key decisions.Some feedback have been received that the reports provided would have a greater effect if they came in a concise manner. I would like you to try and shorten the report and attempt to only include technical information but keep up the suggestions on improvements as a separate segment in the report. That way, we would be able to provide more timely reports catering to the wide audience in mind.

Have a session to get a prioritization of information to be placed in the report. Get his inputs so that both of you would be able to come up with a report which is concise and on time.

The team is happy with your improvement suggestions, genuine enthusiasm for the project, and everyone really likes working with you.  I appreciate your commitment, and I know that travel isn't always easy.  Terry has shared some of your reporting techniques with me. While we appreciate your insights and attention to detail, we are going to need you to shift gears a little to help the team make their deadlines.  It is difficult for the team to easily separate facts from opinions in your reports, and it would be much easier for them to pass on the great information you're sharing if your reports were more concise and organized.I know this change in work habit might be a challenge for you, but it is imperative for the success of the project.  That being said, I've come up with a game plan for getting your reports to where the team needs them to be for success.  Terry has a lot of experience in business writing, and since he is responsible for passing on your reports to customers and our executive leadership team, I've asked him to sit with you for a couple of hours this week to share some of his edits on your previous reports. This is not in any way a negative exercise, and I really believe it will help both you and the team throughout the project.  Please take this opportunity as a learning experience, and reach out to Terry ASAP to schedule the time! Please shoot me a note with your thoughts on this, and let me know if you have any additional ideas on how to further improve the Beta project reporting.

I know you are working on this project with lots of enthusiasm and writing a good report with lots of perspectives of your own on this report.

Terry informed me that he has to spend lot of time in fine tuning your report.

[No empathetic feedback found]
</response>

The feedback focuses solely on criticizing the employee's work and providing directives on what to change, without showing any understanding of the employee's perspective or offering supportive encouragement. Phrases like ""you would only need to provide only technical information"" and ""your project report is getting very detailed and some information is of no use"" come across as blunt criticism rather than empathetic guidance. The statement ""I trust you have understood my message and you will work as per the instruction received for work in this project"" reads more like an instruction than an empathetic appeal. Overall, the feedback lacks empathetic language and a supportive, encouraging tone.",This feedback does not contain any empathetic feedback.,0

118,train,"Good Afternoon Jonathan, I hope you are well and the travelling is not too exhausting. I wanted to touch base with you to see how you are enjoying working with the Beta project team? I have been advised that you are a great contributor and are identifying some great improvements, so well done. I understand you are completing a lot of reports and imagine this is quite time consuming which added to your traveling must be quite overwhelming. I have reviewed some of your reports and whilst they provide all the technical information that is required, they are quite lengthy and i think it would be beneficial for you to have some training on report structures. This would mean you could spend less time on the reports by providing only the main facts needed and perhaps take on more responsibility.  When the reports are reviewed by higher management they need to be able to clearly and quickly identify any issues. Attending some training would also be great to add to your career profile for the future. In the meantime perhaps you could review your reports before submitting to ensure they are clear and consise with only the technical information needed,Let me know your thoughts. Many thanks again and well done for all your hard work. Kind regards William","Here is my analysis of the empathetic feedback in the given text:

Since we can't talk live I am hoping we can discuss the reports, and the excellent data you are providing.   The reports you provide are great so thanks for that.  I would like to see if we could streamline your reports.  This may give you more time, and be less overwhelmed, as you mentioned in your video.

I am not sure if you know that we have some online tools and courses that may help condense some of the information. Again, this may give ease up on your time schedule, and help streamline the reports. What are your thoughts?  I'd like to see if you can give this modified approach to the reports a shot.  Please copy me in on the upcoming report.  If it is helpful, I can have some of the reports that have sent in to give you a framework.  I want you to know that the work you provide is excellent, and if we can organize it so that the data is easily accessible, then the reports can move up the pipeline, and showcase your talent.  As you know Senior Managment sees these reports, and getting the key data points to them in succinct manner will make you even more valuable.  I will have some samples of old reports sent to you.

139,train,"Hello Jonathan, I hope you are doing well. As I am only in office today and you are on a travel, I am contacting you via Mail.I became a feedback from people related to your reports in the Beta project that I want to discuss with you. In general, the team is happy about your skills in contribution and espacially your way to identify improvements they may would have not seen. At first, your technical reports contain too much commentary that are not neccessary and make the report too long. Your ideas and thoughts about the technical solution are important, but you should only note them down separatly to discuss those with the project team, not to write them in the reports.Second is that your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be. to presennt this to customer or our CEO. This requires that the colleagues are correcting your work  what leads due to the high pressure to delays, which is embarassingfor the colleagues who commited end dates.It might be that you will be removed out of the project team Beta because of this. This is not to blame you, we just need to be more efficient in this urgent stage to provide the reports.As I know you are an ambitious employee and you want to do the best. I am also sure you want to be developped in a way that you are getting a lead engineer.  To achieve this target, we need to work on your skills in writing technical reports to only note down the required information. Your technical skiills are already on the required level. In addition, the usiness writing is a topic that we can work on.At first we can agree that you send me each chapter that you finalized so that I can have a review before submitting all to Terry. In addition, we need to check for courses to strengthen you rskills in writing reports as I also want to continue working with you. I see a high potential, we need to sit together to develop you in right directions.I wish you a save travel back. If you have any questions or concerns you can always write or call me.

106,test,"Hi Jonathan, just wanted to discuss the reports you've been submitting on the Beta Project whilst travelling. You mention that it has been challenging whilst travelling, and this certainly can be tricky to manage the time. How are you finding this and is there any help I can assist with on this front? I always find that good reports are short, to the point and convey the most important facts about the data. Additional commentary can often make writing these reports longer than they need to be and ultimately we all have time deadlines to meet. The data on these reports are the most important details to gather and report back on. Would I be able to send over some examples of really good reports and quickly run through the best features of these. As you can now attest to, managing our time on these reports isn't always easy but if we can make these more concise then it really helps everyone else in the team and helps you to stand out. I think at the moment and based on some of the reports submitted so far, there is a great potential to benefit from this exercise.Because of the time pressure on this project we will need to keep checking on these and if you need assistance on anything please don't hesitate to ask. Can I get your commitment on this?","Based on my analysis, here are the sentences/phrases from the feedback that demonstrate empathy, perspective-taking, support and encouragement:
