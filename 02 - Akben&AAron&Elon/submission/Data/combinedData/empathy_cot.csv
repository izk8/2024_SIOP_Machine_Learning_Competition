14,"Hi Jonathan: I hope you are doing great. Thank you for all the excellent work you are doing and appreciate all the passion you exhibit to get the work done. I want to bring out few points to get more impact on findings you do. Hence my suggestion for you would be following. Once you create the reports, I would like you to go through two three times to look at ares where you can bring in refinement, so that it is crisp and concise. As you know our customers and senior leaderships would love to get most important points/snippets when they read reports. Hence it is important that we give them concise reports which will create first impression and hit on the important points.I think if you can do this, you will improve your research quality and report quality, and bring in a new dimension to your overall skills - which is consulting. That would be an awesome skill to acquire and that would give you tremendous opportunities to grow. At the end of the day, we work to make our customers happy and if our customers are happy with quality of the content we provide, we as a team grow exponentially. I would also suggest to work more collaboratively, seek feedbacks from seniors/peers which will only improve your work. We all come with a view, but it is ok to get another view and weigh in every option to decide the best. We all learn from each other and that make us a better person. Let me know if the above make sense. I will be happy to get into a meeting when you are available to discuss this further. Looking forward to your continuous contribution.",0,test,empathy,
3,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are well. It is great to see your enthusisatic participation in the Beta Project. We are glad you are contributing. As i have not been able to connect with you personally, thought of e-mailing a few areas you could focus on to develop further and effectively contribute. I have also collected feedback from team members on the project and recommend these next steps. Significance of Reports: The reports you prepare are tabled with the leadership and support decision making. Hence need to be concise and precise. This could be an area for you to develop further given your aspirationsAction: Would suggest you present the report in 2 sections: FACTs and Your Suggestions/Opinions. This will enable them to understand the facts objectively and judge your thoughts better Development: As your job entails a significant amount of report writing, i highly recommend you to take up a learning course on executive business repiort writing. I shall take this up with the HR team and nominate you for the best course on the subject. Progress: Let us set-up a monthly check-in to monitor your development and for you also to share any feedback. Regards William",0,test,empathy,
197,"Hi Jonathan, Happy to have you working on the Beta project. You are a good contributor and you identify improvements we did not know we needed. As you know, we face difficult deadlines in this project. Therefore, it is important to have clear reports only containing the key technical information. While we appreciate your findings, it makes the reports difficult to read. Next to this, they have too much detail and are not structured enough. As this is an important part of your objectives and as you are ambitious, we want to help you. As we appreciate your findings, I propose you make a separate report on this.Second, I want to recommend to follow a training on business writing. Please send your next reports to me so I can give you feedback. Are there any other things I can do to help you with this?Thanks, William",0,dev,empathy,
93,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing good! Understand that you are quite happy with the Beta Project and gaining a lot of experience out of it. This is really an exciting opportunity for you.Keeping in mind the opportunity comes a bit of responsibility also. Considering the reports that you are sending, it's really good to know that you are giving enough insights in form of commentary along with the technical information. You have done a really good job as far as technical information is concerned, on the other hand one should have an understanding about what exactly the reader of the report wants. In this case they would only want to see the technical information rather than along with your perspectives on the report. Suggest you to concentrate on the technical findings only as this will result in less time spend for the end user to search for the facts and thus will meet the deadlines which I believe has been a struggle in the recent past. I suggest you to just have a quick 10 mins call with me just before submitting the report so that we are on the same page and figure out if the facts are clearly visible.Since you are gaining on experience, I would suggest you to undergo trainings on business writing. By doing so you will understand how to convey your message in a short and crisp way. This will not only save time for yourself and your counter part but will also help you to communicate exactly what you want to.I will suggest your name for the upcoming training and you can participate to change for the better.This is in line with the feedback I received as they are quite happy with the technical facts still there are some areas of improvement. Best Regards, William",0,dev,empathy,
142,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you for all your efforts in helping collect information for the company! Your data are invaluable to our successes. I recently reviewed one of your technical reports and have a few thoughts on it. In order for the readers of your reports to gather all the relevant information quickly and efficiently, your reports need to be more concise. Since everyone, including yourself, is very busy, the reports only should contain the relevant technical information. You may provide some additional commentary if asked by the reader. This will streamline our processes and ensure a smooth transfer of data. I would like for you to review some reports of Alex to see examples of how they should be completed. I have informed Alex of this and he should be setting up a meeting to go over any questions you may have. We can also arrange for you to attend an outside writing course at a local university if that interests you. I know you have been putting in a lot of effort and are enthusiastic about all the information you gather to support our work. This is greatly appreciated. If your reports become more concise & technically proficient, this will only help your career move in a positive direction. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further. Best, William",0,test,empathy,

I understand that you have been putting in a lot of effort in traveling and gathering very good technical information. I'm glad that you are excited about this project and want to share all the information that you have collected. Considering that this project has very technical requirements, and the persons receiving the reports need it in time to decide on the follow up actions, we need clear and concise reports. In view of this, I would appreciate if your trim your reports and focus on the technical aspects of your findings. I know this is a relatively new experience for you, and as such, we could organize a quick technical writing training or you when you are back in the office.

100,"Jonathan, I would like to let you know that I am happy you are excited about your participation in the Beta project. I would also like to share some insights and coaching with you. It has been brought to my attention that your reports are being submitted with commentary and opinion instead of the desired fact based analysis the project requires. I would like to help you be more valuable to the team to make sure you have a shot at that promotion you are looking for.First, please seek out a business writing course. You can contact HR to inquire about available company resources. If ABC-5 does not offer a course I would ask that you research outside sources. This will give you an opportunity to improve yourself and be more valuable to the company as a whole.Second, until you have completed that course please keep your reports fact based. Your valuable commentary and opinions can be submitted via email or as an addendum of the report, but do not include it in the reporting document. This will help the team to quickly decipher the information and be able to report up to the steering committee. this approach will help the team greatly, but also give you the opportunity to provide feedback. Third, I would like you to follow up with me in a month to let me know how the business writing course has helped you. I would love to understand the value of the course you took so that we can assess it as a development tool for the rest of the team. Jonathan, understand that the Beta program is very important and you are a valuable team member. Also understand that you following reporting guidelines is imperative. Rework and deciphering fact from opinion slows the team down.

I also sense that you are really excited about this project and is looking forward to leveraging this project to gain a promotion to lead engineer. In order for your reports to add value to the project and the teams, I would like to highlight these areas of improvement: Clear and concise report. For reports to be easily and quickly understood, it has to be concise and contain only technical information. We noticed that the reports that you submitted consists of both information and opinions. This results in a much longer report than required. Organisation of the report. Organise the report in a logical and structured manner will help your readers understand what you are trying to say. Consider the amount of details in the report, so that the information that you present is meaningful to the reader.With this in mind, how can you change your reporting layout/structure to make it better for our audiences?

He has pointed out two areas that require improvement soon as they are causing additional work when finalizing reports. First, he believes that there is too much commentary in your reports. for the sake of deadlines, only include the most pertinent information your reports. His other concern was that your reports are not to the level they should be. They are unorganized and need extra editing before they can be presented to the prospective clients often times making the reports late. I know that this can be a little discouraging since you've expressed interesting in moving up, but we can definitely work together to help you improve.

Our team member are looking for technical information and redundant comments takes them time to extract the fact and sometime confusing. Another thing is that can help us is to organize the report in a more clear, concise way. We are showing the reports to our prospect and even the CEO, so we need it to be well structured, concise and to the point. I am sure if youspend more time to organize your report, you will be able to address this problem. I know you are an enthusiastic contributor and you have done a good work until now, but we need your reports to be improved for our project team to success. I am afraid if the situationis notgetting better we will have to look for someone else towork on this project.Please spend more effort to organize your next report and I really look forward to your good news",1,train,empathy,"Here is my analysis of the feedback email:

<reasoning>
Sentence 1: The feedback starts by acknowledging the employee's work positively (""your work is really nice insight and improvement ideas""), which is encouraging. It then shares the manager's perspective on what can be improved (""I feel the need to talk to you about what more can be done with your reports"").

Sentence 2: The manager provides specific feedback from the team's perspective about what is lacking in the reports (""more time is needed to spent on extracting information from your reports"" and ""redundant comments takes them time to extract the fact and sometime confusing""). This helps the employee understand the impact of their work.

Sentence 3: The manager provides a clear suggestion for improvement from their perspective of what is needed (""organize the report in a more clear, concise way"").

Sentence 4: The manager explains the importance and purpose of the reports (""We are showing the reports to our prospect and even the CEO""), helping the employee see the bigger picture and understand the ""why"" behind the feedback.

Sentence 5: The manager expresses confidence in the employee's ability to improve (""I am sure if youspend more time to organize your report, you will be able to address this problem""). This is encouraging and motivating.

Sentence 6: The manager again acknowledges the employee's positive qualities and contributions so far (""I know you are an enthusiastic contributor and you have done a good work until now""), which is encouraging, before reiterating the need for improvement.

Sentence 7: The manager shares a potential consequence if the issue is not addressed (""I am afraid if the situationis notgetting better we will have to look for someone else towork on this project""). While this may seem harsh, it provides a clear reason for the employee to take the feedback seriously from the manager's perspective.

Sentence 8: The feedback ends with a specific call-to-action (""Please spend more effort to organize your next report"") and an encouraging look ahead (""I really look forward to your good news"").
</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email exemplifies perspective taking and encouraging feedback in several key ways. First, the manager frequently acknowledges the employee's positive contributions and qualities, which is motivating and encouraging throughout. Second, the manager provides clear and specific feedback on what needs to be improved, but does so by explaining the perspective and needs of the team, prospects, and CEO. This helps the employee understand the reasons behind the feedback. Third, the manager expresses confidence in the employee's ability to improve and meet expectations, which is encouraging. Finally, the feedback ends with both a clear next step and an optimistic look forward. The tone throughout is direct but mostly encouraging. By consistently tying the feedback to the perspectives of others and the employee's own abilities, the manager effectively shapes the feedback as encouraging and motivating.

Sentence 2: ""This is related to Beta project and reports coming from there."" - The abrupt transition to the topic of the email without any further context or explanation can be seen as not-perspective taking. It does not consider whether Jonathan has the necessary information to understand the feedback.

Sentence 3: ""While we are all excited by the passion and enthusiasm you are bringing i wanted to share some early feedback with you."" - Although the sentence starts with a positive note, the phrasing ""i wanted to share some early feedback with you"" can be interpreted as not-encouraging.

Sentence 4: ""1.Please try to be concise in reports and mention facts that teams can refer . We love opinions but lets save those for our brainstorming discussions."" - This sentence is not-perspective taking as it does not consider Jonathan's style or the reasons behind his approach to writing reports.

Sentence 5: ""2.For Business writing as you are getting started to help you set up for success we are nominating you for a training program so that your reports are way more effective."" - While offering training could be helpful, the way it is presented is not-encouraging. The sentence implies that Jonathan's current writing skills are inadequate and need improvement, without acknowledging his efforts or potential.

Sentence 6: ""I hope as you set on your growth journey and take larger roles a superb feedback from your peers and stakeholders will help."" - This sentence is not-perspective taking as it assumes Jonathan's goals and aspirations without considering his personal objectives. It also implies that his current performance is not ""superb,"" which can be discouraging.

Sentence 7: ""I truly believe above two points can really help you take you there."" - While the intention may be positive, the phrasing ""take you there"" is not-encouraging as it suggests that Jonathan is not currently meeting expectations.

Sentence 8: ""Wishing you all the best and do share in case you have feedback or inputs from your side."" - Although the email ends with a positive note, it does not encourage a dialogue or invite Jonathan to share his perspective on the feedback.

Overall, the email lacks a smooth flow and transitions abruptly between different points. The tone is formal and lacks warmth, which can be perceived as not-encouraging.

78,"Jonathan, I want to touch base with you on some feedback that I have heard from the Beta project team. First off I want to say that the team feels that you are a good contributor and that you identify improvement opportunities but they are struggling with a couple of your work habits. The first is that you include too much commentary in your reports. Your reports should contain only technical information and not your perspectives. Going forward you need to improve this and stick to the facts. In addition to this you need to focus on the organization of your reports. Your reports influence some important decisions at ABC-5 and should be the best reflection of your capabilities every time. When your reports are not concise and accurate then they have to be edited by a team member. Because of this feedback I am asking you to think of ways that you can improve your reports and writing skills. Please send them to me by EOB tomorrow and I would also like your commitment that you will work with me to find alternate ways to improve in these areas such as mentoring with a team member that is a great report writter or additional training etc. If you want to stay on the team it is necessary that you improve in both of these areas and I will support you in developing and implementation of an improvement plan over the next 30 days. Please be ready to discuss a 30 day improvement plan by the end of the week. Regards, William ",0,test,empathy,

As such, it is very important that the reports be concise and only include data relevant to the decision-making. When the reports include other data, it prolongs the decision-making process, which makes it difficult for us to meet our deadlines. Your comments within the reports are very insightful and thought-provoking - we appreciate you taking the time to include them. However, going forward, I ask that you please save your comments in a file outside the report.Also, going forward, we will have a template of the report.

The information that you are providing is really good, but can sometimes get a little too verbose.  I would love to work with you on keeping that same passion while doing so in a more concise feedback.  Lets schedule some time next week to meet to work on laying out that plan and formatting reports moving forward more in-line with that senior engineering role you are looking for.

Now that you have become a seasoned contributor, it is time to up your game. To do that, you can work on 2 major improvement areas of your report for which I have received feedback from your team. The first is that you need to make your reports concise. I understand that you like to provide valuable insights but it becomes difficult to take the main points out of the report. What you can do is that you can keep the insights in an annexure This would keep the core of the report intact and would also enable us to go through your valuable insights.Also though your reports are filled with insights, it is important to also structure them properly so that they can be sent to the management directly without much review. It will only enable you to perform at your peak. I believe if you improve on the above 2 items, you would definitely take your performance to the next level and which would further your career growth in the years to come. I can help you in finding a mentor/ attend training programs to improve your skills. Please feel free to call/ message me for a detailed conversation or if you need my guidance.",0,dev,empathy,

I see the passion in your work we just need to focus and streamline it a bit more so that you can deliver a report that is correct and eveyone can understand.I think first things first is to get you enrolled into a training program for businee/report writing to help you get the technical knowledge. i also would like to assign you a mentor that has great experience with report writing that can help you when you need it. We can also have regular check-ins to see how the progress is being made.I know with your travels it might be easeir to do the training online so maybe in the meantime start doing some research on this.

Your reports also have to be reviewed by other team members, so do take note on the timeline and give sufficient time to the rest so that we can achieve the timeline as a team. I have also attached some great technical reports here, hope they would help with your upcoming technical reports and Terry would also be able to provide further training if necessary. I'm very happy to see your enthusiasm to the Beta project and the Company, keep it up! As always, I'm available for any discussions if you need. Warmest Regards!",0,test,empathy,

I wanted to provide you with some additional feedback in order to support your success. I realize that you have not had a lot of experience with technical reports. We should consider some development opportunities in this area. I know Terry is a real expert in this area. i am going to reach out to him and ask him to share some previous reports that you can use as a reference. This will help you make sure you reports are both concise and well-organized. In the meantime I would like you to find additional opportunities to develop these skills. We need to stick to our current set of deliverables to n order to keep the project on track, I need to you focus in on a couple of areas as you wrap up your last report.:Does this report contain technical information only? By sticking to the facts, it will help reduce the length of the report and help make it more concise.Please have a peer review your report before submitting it to Terry.

The team is of high confidence that your information and ideas bring them more opportunities to improve our product, however given the senior management level audience we have for your reports its always best to keep the content precise and factual as it will help them to relate the information and process them better. While you bring such great insights to the team, it only makes sense that this is reaching the senior management who have limited time and will need your ideas reach them crystal clear in most concise form. This will also ensure that your work is directly reaching senior management which gives you more exposure and credibility. This will be a golden opportunity to prove your prowess in providing factual information which are relevant among the vast amount of information you collect and thus help you in a faster career progression.

Your contribution in collecting technical information has been very useful, however there are few concerns / improvement areas that are critical for Terry and is also expected in your support.

The main objective here is to prepare a concise report gathering  technical information that could be used by Terry team. Though you make have good insights, but trust me will not add a lot of value here.2) We see we need to work on your business writing skills that helps make the report more presentable and organized.

12,"Hi Jonathan, Learnt that you are helping the team with Beta project. Glad that you are identifying new improvements as well. Since you know that for a seamless delivery of any project, we don't only need the technical expertise but also a language that bridges the gap between our and our stakeholders' understanding. Today, I wanted to lay out the significance of the same. At an organizational level, we expect certain standards to be followed for Business writing and communication and we want you too to understand for your career growth with us. We appreciate the reports that we create to contain the facts and not the insights derived from those, as those might cloud the understanding and interpretation.To build up an experience with business writing, I am suggesting HR to offer you a business writing and communication course for 2 weeks along with test cases to hone your writing skills.I am sure you will easily fill this gap and add this skill to your personality in order to grow yourself further with us.HR will reach out to know with more details around this. Let me know for questions, if any. Regards, William",0,test,empathy,
25,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're well and the road is treating you well.I've received really positive feedback from Terry, he's been really impressed with your work ethic and he also mentioned you're coming up with improvement recommendation yourself!! Impressive!!I do however need you help with the way we're collecting the data, as you know these reports are being shared with the CEO and are also customer facing. So we must ensure that when these reports are submitted they should only include the facts and if you have some personal views, you can still share them but not in these reports. You will have to share your opinions separately, as we do value your input, but cannot include them in the reports. We also need to work on your layout when putting these reports together to ensure that they are easy to read and the reader gets all the information you are providing. I understand this isnt human nature to a lot of people and its just something we need to support you with, so going forward you need to have either myself (if I'm around) or someone else review them to ensure the reports reflects the best possible outcome for you and the business. I'm keen to see you succeed and this will be valuable development for you as an individual, especially one day if you were interested in stepping up to a lead engineer position once one became available, this is the sort of development and support you could pass on to junior engineers.Let me know if this makes sense and if you have any concerns.

92,"Good Morning Jonathan, I wanted to check in with you. I appreciate you taking the time to send Terry a message about your upcoming report and I do love that you are enthusiastic about the project. You may not be aware but the Beta project reports are submitted to senior level management. These managers receive many reports and are super busy so they require us to provide data concisely as well as factually. For the report you are sending to Terry, I am requesting that you provide the most important info in 2 bullets and then have your amplifying information as well as additional thoughts noted as such,(e.g., What I found out. What I think it means. My thoughts). This way when we are pressed for space in the report we can easily find the information.In addition, I am requesting that you and Terry set up a video chat for 30 min to review the report together. Terry will provide guidance as to what he sees other reports look like and you can provide your most imprortant info to him so he can highlight it without having to guess. We will also be providing a template for future reports in the coming weeks. Look forward to having you back soon, William",1,train,empathy,"Here is my analysis of the feedback email:

141,"Good morning Jonathan, I hope you are well.  I would like to circle back with you regarding the reports that are being sent in. Unfortunately, we are not able to speak live but here are some key points to the way our reports need to be constructed as per the company’s standards. It is critical we keep to the main points for reporting to management. For example, if we add too much of our opinion it may mislead the direction or feedback given. Please ensure your reports are in the format we reviewed; bullet pointed with just the facts.You can always discuss your opinions after with Terry. Secondarily, I would recommend you scheduling a weekly conference call with Terry to work on the way we organize and construct the reports. This will further support upper managements review and understanding of data shared. Will you be able to meet these requirements?  I know you have high aspiration and professional goals to grow and look forward to supporting you getting there. These are some ofthe first steps to ensuring your future success within ABC-5. I will be checking in with Terry monthly to ensure we see improvement. Please let me know if you have questions, concerns or if this direction is not clear. Kind regards, William",0,test,empathy,
99,"Jonathan: It has come to my attention that there are some concerns with the reports you are submitting for the Beta project. While the reports have some very useful information for the team it tends to have to much commentary. The reports must include technical information only. When you have commentary included with the report, the team requires more time to review the report and identify the critical findings which result in a delay in making decisions and moving forward.You are a critical member of the team at ABC-5. I want to make sure you know we are committed to your success at the company. I am going to work wit HR to identify a business writing course/workshop to help you better understand the types of information and the way it needs to be presented in technical reports. I believe this workshop can go a long way in helping you prepare techincal reports that can allow the Beta Project team to identify opportunities areas to enhance our product in a more efficient and timely manner. Your techincal insights have been helpful and I expect them to continue.Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further. Thanks.",0,test,empathy,

I request that you please succinctly explain the issues in your reports and provide a short report summary towards the end.

What I need from you directly is that you create a report for Terry which is technical in nature and focuses on facts.

106,"Hi Jonathan, just wanted to discuss the reports you've been submitting on the Beta Project whilst travelling. You mention that it has been challenging whilst travelling, and this certainly can be tricky to manage the time. How are you finding this and is there any help I can assist with on this front? I always find that good reports are short, to the point and convey the most important facts about the data. Additional commentary can often make writing these reports longer than they need to be and ultimately we all have time deadlines to meet. The data on these reports are the most important details to gather and report back on. Would I be able to send over some examples of really good reports and quickly run through the best features of these. As you can now attest to, managing our time on these reports isn't always easy but if we can make these more concise then it really helps everyone else in the team and helps you to stand out.

Your job is critical to the Beta Project, as you know, and the information you provide is crucial to the success of the project. The issue is with your report writing, and specifically, the format and lack of clarity in some of the reports.  You are really a great contributor, but you are undoing a lot of your good work by adding too much detail, without a lot of structure, and adding opinion, which is not solicited. Remember, the facts are what we need and presented in a manner that allows quick processing of the information and decision making on the part of the person reading the report.I would recommend that you form.

At ABC-5 we strive to continuously improve upon our work and the output we give and as your manager and mentor, there is some feedback that i want to give you so that you can develop and grow at ABC-5. In such high-profile projects like this one, as much as the process of gathering information , going deep into understanding whats happening is important, how the findings are presented especially to the senior leadership is equally important. It is critical that when you submit reports for the project, you clearly distinguish between the facts and what your opinions and insights are. I also want you to take up a course of business writing so that your findings in the reports come out to be more articulate. Your reports influence critical decisions here and I think with overcoming these two areas of development, your growth both personal and professional is bound to happen.

Whenever you finallize your reports, always keep in mind to adress the target group. We are talking here about our top management looking into those reports, so keep the information clear and simple and to the point. Also be as dispassionate as possible, as these reports are a collection of data. Personal recommendations i would recommend to discuss personally with Terry as the project lead. As i'm away please get in personal contact with Terry. He is the project lead and very experienced with those reports. Go pro-actively to him and ask him for his guidance an writing those reports.

When there are meetings planned to go over reports and other business needs that s where everyone can give their own opinions.

It is about your reports' style. Please try to focus purely on facts, not so much on your own conclusions or opinions (you can write these down separately and discuss with me and/or Terry).

156,"Hi Jonathan. I hope this note finds you well! I'm reaching out to discuss the great work you've been doing on the Beta project. As you know, this project is both crucial and time-sensitive (which is the same case as many other projects). I've had a chance to review some of your reports. It's obvious you're super passionate and engaged n the work, and have a hunger to share not only the facts, but also your POV. While this is great, when we're sending out reports to leadership, we have to make sure we're being mindful of their busy schedules/competing priorities. I think we have a chance to help streamline your comms so they're super easy to digest and don't require many rounds of revision before going out the door. I've included a couple best-in-class examples of reports, for you to review. I'd like you to familiarize yourself with this format, taking note of the content included - and not included. You'll note that they just have the facts, not commentary. A hunger to showcase your curiosity and insights is great, but these comms must only include facts.

It is clear that you are excited about this opportunity to be a part of this team and that is great! I do want to provide you some feedback on your work to date to make sure you are on track and working to your full potential to support the group. It is important to remember that this is a fact finding mission. It is important to keep in mind the audience that will inevitably end up reading these reports- high level executives with limited time. It is important to be clear, concise and factual with these reports, which will allow less editing by the rest of the team before final submital. Although I appreciate your passion for the project, it is critical to separate fact from opinion to be successful in this role. Perhaps you could submit your next report directly to me first for review prior to submittal to the rest of the team so I can help ensure you are on track. Also, when you have some free time, give me a call and tell me all the exciting things you are learning with this new project and we can discuss how you can use your performance on this team to leverage this experience for future projects.

It's very clear that you have a passion for the role you play and are a very enthusiastic contributor to the team. Although having a great attitude does go a long way I'd like to discuss the concern with regards to your reports themselves.Your personal insights are not required for the types of reports that you submit for the Beta project. Although you may feel as though these insights are valuable they do not allow the team to quickly and easily define trends in the information. It creates a great deal of added effort on the project lead to review and refine the report to prepare it in a way that it can be analyzed.I urge you to bring any added insights to the lead prior to including them in your report to determine if they are beneficial to the information submitted.Terry has an exceptional background in writing business reports and can help support you in your learning and development. Working with our colleagues and teammates to help build our skills and development creates a collaborative and strong team. You can learn a great deal through others skills and personal insights.

Your current effort is appreciated a lot by the team and I get a lot of positive feedback about your extra mile you are going. Thank you for your work and committment! Nevertheless, there are also some points which could influence the work to be more efficient and effective. Especially your reports could be improved. Currently, they include a lot of details which are not always necessary. Please focus on the most important points and use the project meetings to address any points of improvement or general inputs.Another point is the writing. Please stick to the common business style writing, otherwise it can be misleading to other project memebers. You can find support on the buisness writing style online or we can enrol you in a class by Learning & development from HR. Moreover, the team is here to help and support in case of questions.

Sentence 1: ""Hi Jonathan, First off i'd like to say i'm very pleased to see your enthusiasm towards your work with ABC-5, I appreciate your commitment to doing your best work for the company."" - This opening sentence is positive and acknowledges Jonathan's enthusiasm and commitment. However, it lacks a personal touch and doesn't take into account Jonathan's perspective or feelings.

Sentence 2: ""I would like to offer some insight into your work that should assist you in achieving your goals."" - While this sentence suggests the feedback is meant to be helpful, it assumes that the manager knows what Jonathan's goals are without considering his perspective.

Sentence 3: ""We all need to be continually improving to move forward and I believe I can provide you with some assistance in this area."" - This sentence implies that Jonathan needs improvement without acknowledging his current efforts or successes. It doesn't encourage him to share his own thoughts on areas for improvement.

Sentence 4: ""In regards to your report writing, i'd like to to understand that although your reports cover a lot of good information, we need to keep in mind the target audience and the key objectives of the information."" - This sentence jumps straight into criticism without first recognizing the positive aspects of Jonathan's report writing. It lacks empathy and doesn't encourage a dialogue about the issues raised.

Sentence 5: ""The people that read these need to be able to digest the critical points and understand the facts, so try to find the best way to make the information concise and strictly factual."" - While this provides specific advice, the phrasing ""try to find the best way"" puts the onus on Jonathan without offering concrete guidance or resources to help him improve.

Sentence 6: ""In addition to this, reports are much more useful when the structure or flow of the report is orderly, it asissts the reader in understanding the information within and allows them to make informed decisions based on your data."" - Again, this sentence points out a flaw in Jonathan's work without acknowledging his efforts or providing specific examples of how he could improve the structure and flow of his reports.

Sentence 7: ""It may be a good idea to ask your manager for training opportunities for report writing to develop your skills even further, and be sure to reguarly check in with your manager to make sure your work is aligned with the objectives of the team."" - While suggesting training opportunities is helpful, the manager could have offered to help Jonathan find these resources himself. Encouraging regular check-ins is good, but it could be phrased in a way that promotes more open communication and collaboration.

Sentence 8: ""I hope these points help you in your job. Please keep up the great work! Thank you!"" - The closing sentence is positive but generic. It doesn't reinforce any specific strengths or encourage Jonathan to share his thoughts on the feedback.

The overall tone of the email is formal and impersonal. It lacks empathy and doesn't encourage open dialogue. The feedback jumps from point to point without a smooth flow, making it feel disjointed and less constructive.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email is an example of not-perspective taking and not-encouraging feedback because it fails to consider the employee's perspective, lacks empathy, and does not actively encourage the employee to share their thoughts or engage in a dialogue about their performance. The manager focuses on pointing out areas for improvement without first acknowledging the employee's current efforts and successes. The advice given is generic and doesn't provide specific, actionable steps for the employee to take. Furthermore, the formal and impersonal tone of the email creates distance between the manager and employee, making the feedback less effective. To improve this feedback, the manager should aim to create a more open, collaborative environment that values the employee's perspective and encourages their growth and development.

First of all, your team really values your insights on the production and enjoys your engagement in the process. While the reports to date have been thorough the report needs more organization so that the team can quickly ascertain the facts that needs as they include this information to upper management.  One particular area of concern is that main points or facts are often hard to decipher amongst your own commentary or opinions.  Also some of the wording you are choosing is not as professional as other examples we have seen. To assist you with this process, I want to provide the attached template that we have used in previous reports. In reviewing this reporting, I hope that you can follow the structure going forward and see how your insights can still be included by at the end of the document in a footnote or appendix. To assist with the adding a more organized and professional tone to your writing, I also want to send you to an online training course that should be able to help you streamline your thought process and provide clearer and more concise reporting. If time allows, going forward I would suggest that you send your reports to your counterpoints to provide commentary prior to final submission. I think these tools will help you to excel in this role and provide more value to your team.

It's very important that you listen to this point because it could have a major impact on your participation to the project :you have to separate fact form opinion. Your report can contain only facts. Your opinion can is also interesting but you can't put it in the report, maybe you could make a separate document with those information.you have to work on the organization of the reports, there is a classic model on those type of document and when our managers are reading them they except this model. We can't have creativity on that. Don't hesitate to ask Terry if you need more example.

Your reports are starting to get wider circulation and are critical to meeting or exceeding the sales targets.

Meanwhile some users just require the high-level highlights .  I am hoping you can introduce a 1-page Executive Summary to summaarize the details and continue to attach the full report for reference but also add a Table of Contents by region/sector to make it easier to locate details.

But, at the same time they are not able to meet deadlines due to your expressive and exciting thoughts.

I am committing myself to personally teach you Business writing in addition to making you to go through the e-learning programs on the same. Similarly, I need a commitment from you to adhere to the deadlines and reduce the expressive thoughts and be precise in your insights generation.Sometimes, too many insights also will make the solution more difficult and delay in execution. You provide which are your best 2-3 options/insights for the execution and use the other time to focus on business writing. It will be a win-win for both of us.This will also ensure your are not only technically knowledgeable but also good in writing which will help you to move up the career.Once I am back, let's see the progress.

96,"Hi Jonathan, I'm reaching out to follow up on some feedback I've gotten for your work on the Beta project. Overall, the team really enjoys working with you and they've even pointed out a few improvements you've suggested that have been extremely valuable! I know you're relatively new at this and have been working diligently to get these reports out with a lot of detail and important content. Since you're working so hard and are keen on improving your work and advancing in the company, I think it'd be really valuable to review feedback with other stakeholders of your work on the Beta team. Over the next week or so, please ask Terry to share some of the final edited versions of the reports he's submitted. I think it'll be helpful for you to see what content he's keeping and what he isn't. Remember - people really value your insight on this but content edits can be necessary to play to the correct audience so please keep an open mind. I'd recommend paying attention to final content and clarity and brevity of the article.Remember - often times these are getting passed tot he CEO for reading! They need all the pertinent fact immediately apparent to make fast and accurate decisions.I think with some final product input, we can really make your reports shine to all the people watching as the Beta project proceeds. As we go along, let's keep in contact about it. I want to see you succeed in this role as you clearly have the talent and the passion so let's get these reports dialed in. don't hesitate to give me a call with any questions, William",0,test,empathy,
195,"Hello Jonathan, I hope this email finds you well. I have seen that you have been helping out with the Beta project for some time, and I do appreciate your effort and time that you have been invested into this. However, I do also need your attention on the following points that I think you need to improve to be more efficient with your job flow and more effectively to communicate with your colleagues. I understand the working background where you are coming from which hinders you from communicate within the organization professionally and effectively. However, I do believe that if you can specifically improve the following two things, you will go much further in your career. Try to put less of commentary in your report, because these are opinions not facts, which will create extra problems that are not necessarily healthy in the team problem solving environment. Try to improve your business writing skills that can help you be more organized and pin-point the importance of the matters that you want to state. You can use your spare time to self study online and read books regarding how to improve your written skills.I really want your attention and commitment on these two matters, because I am writing to you to make you a better fit in the organization and I hope all the best for your career advancement. It is for you but the same time also for the company, we want everyone to succeed in their career.I would like to get an update from you regarding how you would improve these two matters in the following two days, and I like to see your action plan accordingly. I will tell you in advance that I will meet up with you bi-weekly to see if you have done anything differently. There will be a three month watching time from me to see how you can improve yourself, there will be an assessment towards the end of this. I do hope you can pass the assessment, and I wish you the best for your career in ABC-5. BR, William ",0,test,empathy,
130,"Jonathan, First I want to thank you for your help with the Beta project.  However,  it has been brought to my attention that perhaps ABC-5 didn't do enough to prepare you for the extra work and I would like to discuss some issues. The nature of these reports requires them to be technical in nature.  Your insights are very valuable and much appreciated but as the old line goes ""please give me just the facts"".  Given the critical nature of the information you are providing I can't stress the importance of concise yet detail factual reports.  I would like to review your reports as a training exercise to help you better meet the team requirements.  Given that there are some major reports coming up in the immediate future, I would like you to review some training options and then present a report for review.  Again your insights are appreciated but we need to make sure we are presenting the end-use with only the information they need to make a sound business decision. I also understand you would like to grow into a leadership position so I would like to discuss how successfully implementing these changes would be beneficial in demonstrating an ability to grow and take on new challenges. ",0,train,empathy,"<reasoning>
Sentence 1: The opening sentence thanks Jonathan for his help, which is a positive start. However, the use of ""However"" immediately shifts the tone, suggesting that the following feedback will be critical.

Sentence 2: This sentence implies that ABC-5 may not have adequately prepared Jonathan for the extra work. While it acknowledges a potential issue on the company's side, it does not take into account Jonathan's perspective or challenges he may have faced.

Sentence 3: The manager emphasizes the technical nature of the reports, which is fair, but the phrasing ""please give me just the facts"" comes across as dismissive of Jonathan's insights and contributions.

Sentence 4: The manager stresses the importance of concise and factual reports, which is reasonable. However, the tone is quite stern and does not acknowledge any positive aspects of Jonathan's work.

Sentence 5: Suggesting a review of Jonathan's reports as a ""training exercise"" implies that his work is subpar and requires correction. This approach does not encourage growth or recognize any strengths in his current work.

Sentence 6: The manager mentions upcoming major reports and asks Jonathan to review training options. While training can be beneficial, the manner in which it is presented here feels more like a punishment than an opportunity for growth.

Sentence 7: The manager reiterates that Jonathan's insights are appreciated but immediately follows up with the need to present only necessary information. This feels like a backhanded compliment and does not encourage Jonathan to continue providing valuable insights.

Sentence 8: The manager acknowledges Jonathan's desire to grow into a leadership position but ties it to successfully implementing the suggested changes. This feels like a veiled threat rather than an encouragement to take on new challenges.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email is an example of not-perspective taking and not-encouraging feedback because it fails to consider Jonathan's point of view and does not provide constructive support for his growth. The manager's tone is stern and critical, focusing primarily on the shortcomings of Jonathan's work without acknowledging any positives. The suggestions for improvement are presented as corrective measures rather than opportunities for development.

The email does not take into account any challenges Jonathan may have faced due to lack of preparation from ABC-5. It also dismisses his insights and contributions, making him feel unvalued. The manager's language, such as ""please give me just the facts"" and tying leadership growth to implementing changes, comes across as discouraging and threatening rather than supportive.

Overall, the email lacks empathy, understanding, and a genuine desire to help Jonathan grow and succeed in his role. To be more perspective-taking and encouraging, the manager should acknowledge Jonathan's efforts, provide specific and constructive feedback, and offer support and resources for his development.

I understand you've been a valuable part of this project.I've received some feedback about how we can improve your contribution to the project,  specifically as it relates to your reports.  I appreciate you may not have a lot of experience writing these types of reports, so I'm hoping you'll take this feedback to heart and recognize that this might be an area of improvement for you and that making improvements here can be important to your development within the company. Specifically, try to keep in mind what the readers of these reports are looking for.  I believe the report-readers will benefit from clear, concise, and fact-driven reports.  While I'm sure your own personal perspectives are insightful, they are not really the purpose of these reports, and they may be creating more work for the individuals that are tasked with editing your reports.  When considering the reader of these reports, also consider the organization of your reports and how to communicate your findings and data most efficiently to a reader.  It is important these reports are clear, concise, and well-organized.I'd be happy to work with you on your report-writing or to team you up with a colleague who has experience; this way I'm hoping you can turn this into one of your strengths.

For you next report, please make some changes in your process. I suggest making an outline of key points that showcase the important ideas you are trying to communicate. Your enthusiasm is great but will be better shown by organizing the technical points that need to be shared. Your insights and opinions should not be part of a fact sheet about the project. Pleaseemail meyour next report so we may discuss the format as moving forward the reports need to follow a more concise format.

Couple of things that I wanted to shared with you are mentioned below, unfortunately since we could not connect personally I am listing them down. It is great that you have so much information about so many products but it would be better if you limit the size of the report. From reader's perspective it becomes really overwhelming to read so much and derive a useful conclusion out of it. You can keep noting down your observations in another document and probably after this project we can circulate it to relevant stakeholders!I saw your message, and i could see that you are quite eager to explore new opportunities and collect as much information as possible. Would just suggest that for now you only focus on doing your work best possible way, promotion and payhike will come to you eventually basis your performance.I would also like to understand in case you are facing any issue in incorporating above feedbacks, so that we as team can work towards making these reports more  useful for Terry and his team.Let us work together towards this endeavor.Thanks, William",0,dev,empathy,

Your reporting have been beneficial but we need to streamline your content to make provide all needed technical details with less commentary. The time it takes to update your reports is taking away from other critical matters. Going forward I want you to review your report after Terry has made updates to understanding what we are looking to receive from you and make sure your current reporting content is similar.

Jonathan, I need for you to work on the structure and presentation of your reports.I appreciate all of your ideas and insights, but in your reports, there's often personal opinions mixed in with technical information, which essentially causes added work of editing. What I need from you is to become more concise. Also, how you structure your report is just as important as the content. I need for you to make sure that it is organized and clear for our editors to read. Some ways you can improve include rereading the reports aloud before sending them in or asking your peers for advice until you feel 100% confident. You expressed your concerns with collecting so much information. I would love to help you condense all of your learnings and structure your reports to where all of your topics are clearly outlined.

122,"Hello Jonathan, I am writing in regards to the technical reports that you submit using the information you are collecting.  Your reports are extremely detailed and provide all of the data needed to make decisions, and your insights and conclusions are well thought out.  However, as these are technical reports, it is always a good idea to separate the facts and data from personal conclusions, to allow others to draw their own conclusions from the information provided.  From what I've heard, there is a lot to be gained from your experience and first hand knowledge.  I would suggest that you include your comments and ideas in a separate appendix to your report.  This would allow reviewers to gain the main points of the report, but also allow them the opportunity review your conclusions on the data.  Also, providing a more concise report allows others to draw their own conclusions, and they are then able to contact you, personally, if they would like more information on the subject. I know that business writing can be a daunting task, and we've all had to learn ways to get our thoughts down in a way that is both professional and easily understood.  I know I have!

I know that others have been helping to organization, edit, and re-write some of the report before passing it along to prospective customers or internal managers, so I'd like you to take more of a role in making sure your reports are summarized in a way that can really illustrate your findings. I'll attach some good example reports, so please take a look at them and write down questions/ comments, so that when I return,we can discuss any questions you have when I return.

It has been noted that your contributions are providing real value and they enjoy working with you, however, some of this value is spoiled by a conversational tone and being a bit verbose. In business correspondence it is essential that the facts are clear, concise and distinguishable from opinion, otherwise the message may be lost (regardless of how good it is).There are a number of significant reports required in the coming weeks. Please could you ensure that you confirm with Terry the exact detail and format required for specific reports and communication. He should be able to provide templates and guidance to ensure that his requirements are met.

Sentence 1: The opening sentence is neutral and seeks information about the project's progress. It does not demonstrate perspective-taking or encouragement.

Sentence 2: While acknowledging that Jonathan is enjoying the role and finding new applications, the sentence does not delve into his perspective or provide specific encouragement.

Sentence 3: Although the feedback from Terry confirms that Jonathan is doing well, the focus quickly shifts to ""improvement points"" without providing a balanced perspective or encouraging his strengths.

Sentence 4: The sentence acknowledges that Jonathan's contributions provide value and that people enjoy working with him. However, it immediately follows with criticism about his conversational tone and verbosity, overshadowing the positive aspects and lacking perspective on his communication style.

Sentence 5: This sentence emphasizes the importance of clear, concise, and fact-based communication in business correspondence. While it provides guidance, it does not consider Jonathan's perspective or offer encouragement in improving his communication skills.

Sentence 6: Instructing Jonathan to confirm the exact detail and format required for reports and communication with Terry shows a lack of perspective-taking. It assumes that Jonathan has not been doing so and does not encourage him to take initiative or ownership in understanding the requirements.

Sentence 7: Recommending a report-writing course to help Jonathan convey his ideas effectively is a positive step. However, the phrasing ""ensure that you convey your great ideas in the best possible way"" lacks perspective on his current communication abilities and does not provide specific encouragement.

The email feedback lacks perspective-taking and encouragement due to its focus on improvement points and criticism without adequately acknowledging Jonathan's strengths and contributions. While it mentions positive aspects like Jonathan enjoying the role and providing value, it quickly shifts to areas of improvement, overshadowing the encouragement. The feedback does not actively seek to understand Jonathan's perspective or provide specific examples of how he can develop his skills. The tone of the email is more instructional and corrective rather than empathetic and supportive. To be more perspective-taking and encouraging, the email could have started by genuinely recognizing Jonathan's efforts, seeking his input on challenges faced, and collaboratively discussing strategies for growth while offering concrete support and resources.

Sometimes, opinions could be wrong either due to our biasness or our lack of knowledge, hence facts based report would make the report more credible.2) Length: As this report is for our customer or CEO, they would appreciate if the report is high level, containing only information that they have to know to make a decision.

1. ""Hi Jonathan, I would like to bring to your attention that your report writing should be improved."" - This opening sentence immediately points out a flaw in Jonathan's work without acknowledging any positive aspects, setting a negative tone from the start.

2. ""Your contribution and fact gathering are highly appreciated."" - While this sentence recognizes Jonathan's efforts, it feels like a brief, obligatory acknowledgment before diving into criticism.

3. ""However, when you compose the ideas into reports, it will be more productive to the team if you could separate the facts from your opinions."" - This sentence implies that Jonathan's current report writing is not productive for the team, without seeking to understand his perspective or reasons for including opinions.

4. ""Your reports influence some very critical decisions at ABC-5. So a well written report will benefit many people including having higher visibility to high-ranking managers."" - While this statement highlights the importance of well-written reports, it also puts pressure on Jonathan by emphasizing the critical nature of the decisions and the visibility to high-ranking managers.

5. ""Please clarify with Terry on report format that is most useful for him."" - This sentence directs Jonathan to seek guidance from Terry without offering any support or resources from William himself.

6. ""Please keep the promised deadline. Terry needs your report so that he can compose the project report for the higher managers.

Your report is very informative and it has very detailed information and that reflects your dedication and involvement in project. Appreciate your efforts ! Since this report is reviewed by the CEO, I would recommend you to revisit the same so important message can be given since he has to get right conclusive message and summary in short review.

188,"Hi Jonathan, I would have liked to meet you in person or spoken directly since I was back in office for a day, but this will probably do for the moment. I can see that you have been quite involved with the Beta project and been contributing to a great extent with your reports. There is some feedback that I have received and would like to discuss the same with you.The reports that you have submitted seem to have a mix of facts, surrounding details and your opinions put together in a slightly disarrayed manner. This would mean that the reports become unnecessarily lengthy and probably difficult to grasp. Your reports are very critical to the project and it is important that we keep these reports to the point and completely fact-based, to save the group's time and effort to decipher the report. I hope you understand the important role that you have to continue playing and to ensure your reports serve their purpose to the greatest extent. To support you in this endeavour to more concise report writing, I shall request Mary to share some writing tips with you. Given her experience in writing technical documents, she will definitely be of great help.Let's get working towards this goal and meet up when I back from my assignment in a couple of weeks.

110,"Hello Jonathan, I hope you are well and enjoying the travel for the Beta project. I would like to take some time to discuss an issue we are having with the technical reports.I have observed on  several reports that the technical reports have:A) facts mixed with opinionsB) reports that are too lengthy, containing too much detailC) the reports are poorly organized in thoughts and structureIt is important that the technical reports are technically fact based, concise, and arranged in a logical structure. This will ensure that the reports are delivered on time (not delayed due to rewriting), easy to read by other high-ranking managers, and that PMS makes the correct critical decisions based on these reports. I know that you have a view to being promoted to lead engineer, where report writing will be critical to your success.  ABC-5 really values the job you are doing in the field and identifying improvements, and if we could just correct this one issue, I am sure this would secure your continued success on this project.So, based on this information and observations that I have provided, what is your view? Do you see it the same way, or is their other details that you would like to share?Assuming that we both agree on the issue, what suggestions would you have to correct these reports? While you are thinking about solutions, here are a few ideas you could consider:perhaps developing a template to follow, to help organize the thoughts and structure in advance?Terry is an experienced report writer, would you feel comfortable asking for some tips and mentoring?What other ideas would you like to explore? I am looking forward to hearing your solutions.By the next technical report, I would like to see an improvement in the complexity and brevity of the report.

<reasoning>
Sentence 1: The opening is friendly and shows interest in the employee's travels, which is a positive start.

Sentence 2: Asking to ""catch up"" on the reports implies the manager wants an update and to discuss them collaboratively with the employee. This takes the employee's perspective into account.

Sentence 3: While noting the employee's ""fantastic"" contributions is encouraging, saying ""we need to limit the commentary and make them more concise"" focuses on negatives and doesn't provide clear guidance. It risks making the employee feel criticized without a path to improve.

Sentence 4: Saying ""I would love to get your perspective"" is very perspective-taking, as it directly asks for the employee's point of view. Offering to show an example is also constructive. 

Sentence 5: ""Our goal is to continue to make you better"" frames the feedback around the employee's growth and development, which is encouraging. Mentioning delivering excellent customer experience connects their improvement to a larger purpose.

Sentence 6: ""Looking forward to tackling this together"" emphasizes collaboration and shared effort between manager and employee. ""Your dedication to being great at what you do"" praises the employee's work ethic and ends on an encouraging note.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
While this email does have some elements that are not fully perspective-taking or encouraging, on the whole it is a relatively perspective-taking and encouraging piece of feedback. The manager shows interest in the employee as a person, asks for their point of view, offers to show examples of what they want, frames the feedback around the employee's development and greater purpose, and emphasizes collaboration and the employee's positive qualities. The main part that is not perspective-taking and encouraging is the vague criticism about limiting commentary and being more concise without elaborating on what that looks like. But the other perspective-taking and encouraging elements outweigh that single sentence. So in summary, I would characterize this as a mostly perspective-taking and encouraging feedback email, contrary to how it was classified in the prompt.

I am writing to you regarding the Beta project - first of all, thank you for your commitment and hard work on this project, I am happy to see you motivated and excited about this challenging project. I noticed that your reports come with many details and that you also include personal considerations in it. Some feedback from my side, which I think it's important also considering your aspiration to move up to Lead Engineer in the future.Consider *who* you are writing these reports to - the end recipient is the customer or our CEO, and he/she has usually limited amount of time to scroll through and gather as much information as possible, from an objective point of view. If you want to be a Lead Engineer in the future and lead a team, you will be in the very same situationBe concise, precise, and put in only hard-facts statement. Organize it in a clear structure, with bold titles and few, relevant bullet points  with information relevant from a managerial standpoint. Keep in mind the end-recepient of the reports.

23,"Hi Jonathan, I learnt that you are working on Beta project and providing excellent information to Terry. Here are few points i would like you to take care: It has been observed that your report is having too much of information, i request you to please summarize it with the facts and relevant data. you can share your assumptions separately. because having too much of information in the report may loose interest. Generally Beta project team is concern only about the facts so our reports should contain only facts. I really appreciate you for your excellent findings and opinions, and i do understand you are new for business writing and dont have much experience in this area. So i you go through a formal training for business writting it will add up value to your reports. I have requested Terry to arrange a formal training as per your available schedule. please go thriugh that.I hope you do understand the concern here but still if you feel we can discuss further please let me know we can discuss.

103,"Hi Jonathan, While I'm out of the office, I'd like to provide some feedback to you regarding the Beta projects and the format of the reports. First, I appreciate your zeal for the work that you are doing. Given that we are under tight deadlines to make some important decisions, the reports that are being provided need to be concise and direct. I understand that there is a lot of information coming in, but the reports need to be filtered to contain only the most important information so that we are providing clear direction to our customers and management team. I have a couple of recommendations for you moving forward:Please review the attached reports as these are excellent examples of the type of communication that has worked well in the past.Prior to submitting the report, please review all information and ensure that you are communicating and prioritizing details before submitting. Bullet points typically work well so that the report can be reviewed quickly.There is a course that may help with best practices on business writing to help with improving these reports. I'd like for you to find some time over the next few weeks to participate.Lastly, if you have any specific questions on how the reports should be  formatted, please reach out. I'm traveling but will be available to provide feedback via email or over the phone. Lets discuss once you have reviewed the reports and taken the course to discuss any additional questions you may have. Thanks, William",0,test,empathy,
173,"Good morning Jonathan, I received your video message and you seem very excited about the Beta project and the critical work your doing.  Im looking forward to your report but I did want to bring up a couple things that may help you.  I dont know if we covered this before assigning you this project but the group your reports go to are responsible for presenting them to the CEO who is looking for the facts about your findings in order to make critical decisions.  I would like you to keep this in mind when you write your next report so you can keep it fact based in the body of the report and add your opinion or solutions as an addendum as a separate piece at the end.  They are also very busy and sometimes may need to hand your report directly to the CEO without going through it beforehand.  With this in mind please write it as a fact based business report that may end up on the CEOs desk. This is a great opportunity fo you to have access to upper management and allow you to pursue your career growth within the company if done correctly. Please email me when you receive this with questions and the changes you will make to your future reports.  We can talk about specific examples if needed. I would like to than you again for your passion and energy for the Beta project.",0,test,empathy,

Sentence 1: ""Hi Jonathan, How are You doing with the Beta project? It seams You are very exited about the project."" - This opening seems casual and friendly, but the misspelling of ""seems"" and ""excited"" sets an unprofessional tone.

Sentence 2: ""There are two topics that I want to point out that I expct to be Your focus on this project."" - The misspelling of ""expect"" and the lack of clarity in the sentence structure make the expectations unclear and the tone a bit harsh.

Sentence 3: ""I review the latest report and saw that in addition to a tchnical information that we have agreed to be included in that, there is a lots of commentaries from Your side."" - The misspellings (""technical,"" ""a lot"") and grammatical errors make the feedback seem careless. The phrase ""from Your side"" seems to distance the writer from the employee, rather than fostering collaboration.

Sentence 4: ""It is greeate that You see the opportunities and perspectives on the findings but I ask You to focus on collecting and passing on the technical information according to the agreed template."" - While the writer acknowledges the employee's insights, they immediately dismiss them and redirect the focus. This does not encourage the employee's input or perspective.

Sentence 5: ""We can focus on Your ideas separately once the Beta gets to that stage."" - This sentence further dismisses the employee's ideas, suggesting they are not valuable at the current stage. It does not show an openness to the employee's perspective.

Sentence 6: ""The second thing I'd like you to focus is the organizing the details in the reports. Please work together with Terry on that."" - The grammatical error ""focus is the organizing"" makes the instruction unclear. Directing the employee to work with Terry without explaining why or how it will be beneficial does not demonstrate perspective-taking.

Sentence 7: ""As the deadlines for presenting the reports to CEO are quite challenging, they have lost of hints and tricks how to make the report informative and easy to read."" - The phrase ""lost of hints and tricks"" is unclear and does not provide concrete guidance. It does not show an understanding of the challenges the employee may face in meeting the deadlines.

Sentence 8: ""I've have used his experience and competence myself."" - This sentence has a grammatical error (""I've have"") and does not clearly explain how the writer's experience with Terry is relevant to the employee's work.

Sentence 9: ""It is very important that we submit the report on time."" - While emphasizing the importance of meeting deadlines, the writer does not acknowledge any challenges the employee may face or offer support to help them meet the deadline.

Sentence 10: ""Please add me as well to the reciepient list once You send the infotmation to Terry."" - The misspellings (""recipient,"" ""information"") and the lack of a clear reason for being added to the email chain do not demonstrate trust in the employee's ability to communicate effectively with Terry.

Sentence 11: ""Good luck!"" - While intended as a positive closing, ""Good luck"" on its own does not provide any specific encouragement or support for the employee in tackling the assigned tasks.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email is an example of not-perspective taking and not-encouraging feedback due to several key elements. First, the numerous misspellings, grammatical errors, and unclear sentence structures throughout the email create a careless and unprofessional tone. This suggests a lack of effort in understanding and addressing the employee's needs.

Second, the writer dismisses the employee's ideas and perspectives, asking them to focus solely on technical information without considering their insights. This fails to demonstrate openness to the employee's point of view and does not encourage their contributions.

Third, the writer directs the employee to work with Terry without providing a clear rationale or support, which does not show an understanding of the employee's challenges or needs. The emphasis on meeting deadlines without acknowledging the employee's efforts or offering assistance further demonstrates a lack of perspective-taking.

Overall, the email's tone, lack of clarity, and dismissal of the employee's ideas create a not-perspective taking and not-encouraging feedback environment. To improve, the writer should strive for clearer communication, acknowledge the employee's efforts and insights, and provide more specific guidance and support.

153,"Hi Jonathan, I am glad to hear that you are enjoying your job,  traveling and learning more about the Beta ray technology. I wanted to share some feedback with you that I received. I want to help you be able to advance in your career and I feel that this feedback will be helpful. I am excited that you are will to share your perspectives on the findings, however if you could focus on the data portion first, and highlight the main points, that would be really beneficial to your audience. By being more concise it will allow the potential customers and then CEO to focus on the facts of the report, which will allow them to make a decision for themselves. I understand that this is probably a newer to writing the reports, and I don't think that anyone has shown you an example of how the reports are usually written, so I have sent you some examples for you to review. I think that you are doing a good job learning and with this little tweak in the report writing you will be able to advance in your career. In order to help you, if you don't mind, I would like to review the report before you submit it and then we can work together to ensure it will be a great report. I understand that you really enjoy providing your perspectives on the technology and recommendations on how it can be used, so we will find a spot for that in the report as well, but perhaps in a different section. Thank you so much for your time today and I look forward to working with you. ",0,train,empathy,"<reasoning>
Sentence 1: The opening sentence is positive and shows that the manager is glad the employee is enjoying their job and learning. This sets a good tone for the feedback.

Sentence 2: The manager says they want to help the employee advance in their career, which is encouraging. However, the phrasing ""I feel that this feedback will be helpful"" centers the manager's perspective rather than the employee's.

Sentence 3: While the manager says they are excited the employee is willing to share their perspectives, they immediately pivot to telling the employee to focus on the data portion first. This discounts the employee's approach without seeking to understand their reasoning.

Sentence 4: The manager states that being more concise will allow the audience to focus on the facts and make their own decision. While this may be true, it's phrased as an directive without considering why the employee took a different approach.

Sentence 5: The manager acknowledges the employee may be new to writing these reports and hasn't been shown examples, which is somewhat perspective-taking. However, characterizing it as ""this is probably a newer to writing the reports"" downplays the employee's skills.

Sentence 6: Saying the employee is doing a good job learning is encouraging, but is undermined by characterizing the feedback as ""this little tweak"" which minimizes the ask being made of the employee.

Sentence 7: Offering to review the report before submission and work together is supportive. However, ""we can work together to ensure it will be a great report"" implies the employee can't write a great report on their own.

Sentence 8: The manager acknowledges the employee enjoys providing their perspective and recommendations, which is perspective-taking. However, ""we will find a spot for that in the report as well, but perhaps in a different section"" still asserts control over the employee's approach.

Sentence 9: Thanking the employee for their time and saying they look forward to working together ends on a positive, encouraging note. However, it doesn't offset the overall tone and approach of the feedback.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
While this feedback email has some positive and encouraging elements, overall it is more an example of not-perspective taking and not-encouraging feedback. The manager centers their own views and doesn't seek to fully understand the employee's perspective or reasoning behind their approach. Much of the feedback is phrased as directives telling the employee what they need to change, rather than collaborating with them or asking questions to understand their viewpoint. The manager does acknowledge the employee is new and learning, but in a way that minimizes their capabilities. Some word choices like ""this little tweak"" and ""we can work together to ensure it will be a great report"" undermine the encouraging sentiment by implying the employee's work requires fixing and can't be great on its own. So while the manager likely has good intentions, the lack of perspective-taking and overly directive tone make this feedback less encouraging and effective than it could be.

While your opinions on the technical details and requirements are appreciated, in the reports we need to focus on the technical requirements that have data to support them.

But once you're done, do multiple reviews and question yourself on each segment, if it is really important, can this be concise, is this repetitive. With each review, your reports will definitely improve.Stick to technical facts: While I understand the urge to provide explanations and inferences so you can provide a detailed picture. You can structure it differently. Create a main concise section with only the important points, which should be the final report. You can add additional reference section with the details for anyone who needs more information.  This will allow people who do not have the time to read the detailed reports to also get the gist.Enroll for Business Writing training program:  Get in touch with HR to help you find a suitable program.

Additonal commentary you can do a summary at the end of the report. - Please review timelines with Terry - we need to help get him your great information in a concise timely manner as he needs to relay it up to others that need to understand your feedback quickly and move on to decisions. -I'd like you to ask Terry what specific information that he needs from the reporting and come up with a template that you can use weekly. We put you on this project so that you could continue to learn and grow. I appreciate your help with this and helping us to streamline. We will review when I return, in the meantime thanks for giving your focus to this. ",0,test,empathy,
42,"Hi Jonathan, In speaking with Terry, he told me that you have been a good contributor to the the Beta Team and have identified improvements that we didn't know we needed. Great job on being a team player! While I love the enthusiasm you bring to the team, we definitely need to stick to the facts in our reports and leave our own perspectives out. Terry mentioned that the reports have too much commentary and are too lengthy. I want you to work on only providing the technical information from here on. I also gave Terry a book on business writing that I want you to read. It can really help you grow and develop in your career! I know you are looking to move up the ladder so expanding your business writing skills now will be key. On your next report focus on being organized and concise, providing only the technical information. I will have Terry follow up with me on your development in two weeks.",0,dev,empathy,

Writing to you regarding your contribution in the Beta project. Your contribution is highly appreciated and is very critical for the project's success. The insights you bring in are really useful and liked by the managers above. However, it would be great if we could sort out one of the challenges that the team brought out in our recent discussions. Since the project is running on strict deadlines, they would love it if your reports are more concise and bring out facts prominently. Sometimes the team has to spent a lot of time in digging through the reports to find the factual information. I understand that you are super excited with all that is going around in the Beta world, however, try putting those in the additional annexures so that the team can focus on important stuff. Also, I was wondering if you would like to attend some of the business writing training that  we have in our organisation. They will really help you with this and also in enhancing your reports so that the are more impactful. I know this is critical year for you in terms of your career growth and this could really help you go that extra mile.

1. ""Good Afternoon Jonathan, I hope you are well and the travelling is not too exhausting."" - This opening sentence shows some concern for the employee's well-being, but it doesn't delve deep into understanding their perspective or challenges.

2. ""I wanted to touch base with you to see how you are enjoying working with the Beta project team?"" - The question about enjoyment is a positive start, but it doesn't encourage the employee to share their honest thoughts or feelings.

3. ""I have been advised that you are a great contributor and are identifying some great improvements, so well done."" - While this sentence offers praise, it is based on second-hand information and doesn't provide specific examples of the employee's contributions.

4. ""I understand you are completing a lot of reports and imagine this is quite time consuming which added to your traveling must be quite overwhelming."" - This sentence acknowledges the employee's workload and travel, but it doesn't encourage them to express their feelings or offer any concrete solutions to alleviate the overwhelming situation.

5. ""I have reviewed some of your reports and whilst they provide all the technical information that is required, they are quite lengthy and i think it would be beneficial for you to have some training on report structures."" - This feedback is not perspective-taking as it jumps straight into criticism without first understanding the employee's approach or reasoning behind the lengthy reports. It also suggests training without considering the employee's thoughts on the matter.

6. ""This would mean you could spend less time on the reports by providing only the main facts needed and perhaps take on more responsibility."" - While offering a potential benefit, this sentence doesn't encourage the employee to share their own ideas for improvement or consider if they want additional responsibilities.

7. ""When the reports are reviewed by higher management they need to be able to clearly and quickly identify any issues."" - This sentence explains the reason for the suggested changes but doesn't encourage a dialogue about how to best achieve this goal collaboratively.

8. ""Attending some training would also be great to add to your career profile for the future."" - Although framed positively, this sentence pushes the idea of training without seeking the employee's input or considering their career goals.

9. ""In the meantime perhaps you could review your reports before submitting to ensure they are clear and consise with only the technical information needed,Let me know your thoughts."" - While encouraging the employee to review their work, this sentence doesn't provide a clear opportunity for the employee to share their thoughts on the feedback or suggest alternative solutions.

10. ""Many thanks again and well done for all your hard work. Kind regards William"" - The closing sentence offers appreciation but doesn't encourage further dialogue or emphasize the value of the employee's perspective.

<analysis>
This email is an example of not-perspective taking and not-encouraging feedback because it fails to deeply understand the employee's point of view and doesn't actively encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings. The feedback jumps quickly into criticism and suggestions without first seeking to understand the employee's perspective on their work and challenges. While the email acknowledges some difficulties the employee faces, like a heavy workload and frequent travel, it doesn't encourage them to express how they feel about these issues or collaborate on solutions.

The suggested changes and training are presented without considering the employee's input or career goals, which doesn't foster a sense of ownership or engagement. Although the email includes some positive remarks, they lack specificity and don't create a strong foundation for an open, two-way dialogue. Overall, the tone of the email is more directive than encouraging, focusing on what the employee should do rather than inviting them to share their perspective and ideas. To be more perspective-taking and encouraging, the email should ask open-ended questions, seek to understand the employee's point of view, and collaboratively explore solutions that align with their goals and well-being.

89,"Hello Jonathan, How are you? I know that you are traveling and hence figured that writing to you would be the best way to reach you. I have received very good feedback about your contributions to the Beta project. Congratulations!Jonathan, along with all the good things I heard about you, there is a concern that has come up. This is regarding the reports that you have been submitting. Your reports seem to have too many details and are poorly organized. I understand that you try to share your insights on the Beta project through these reports. However, it would really bring out your best work if you keep your reports restricted to only the technical information and more concise. Would you like some help to hone your business writing skills? If yes, please reach out to HR for access to business writing courses or trainings. Do set up some time with Terry for him to take you through some reports he has drafted. I would also recommend you to read some of your reports that Terry has edited before sending to our prospective customers or ABC-5's CEO. I'm sure you understand that as important as it is to do a good job, it is also important to be able to draft reports that help others get to the most important facts quickly and in the best way possible.  Here is another idea. Would you consider having verbal discussions or virtual meetings with the team to share the information that you consider really valuable to the team? I am sure the team would love to learn from the unique insights and perspectives that you have on the Beta project. Let me know what you think. In case you need any support from me or if there is any way I can help you with this, please do let me know. I really appreciate all the hard work that you have put in for this project. Do keep up your enthusiasm and I hope to hear a lot more great feedback about you when I come back.Good luck! Regards, William.  ",0,test,empathy,

I know you want to be promoted to lead engineer, so let's work together to get the business what you it needs. Firs off, I appreciate the fact that you have suggestions about the data, but how about you add them on a separate section of the report instead of embedding them in the actual data. Also, I would like you to take a business writing  training and have a meeting with Terry's team to get the requirements for the reports.

In particular, you seem to accumalte a lot of useful information of the project, which is very good. On the other hand, I am also received feedback from people working with the reports, that it is hard for them to actually process all the information contained within. This isn't to say the information you gathered is useless, it just needs to be presented in a more structured and concise form. I know you being a technician, this isn't always easy, but it really is something you need to work on to make your work even more effective.

26,"Hi Jonathan, I hear you are doing a great job on the Beta project. Thank you for your contribution. While the technical findings of your report are very insightful and accurate there are some concerns about the length of the report and the manner in which they are structured. As these reports are very important to the organization we need to ensure they are precise, concise and to the point. I have 2 feedback pointers for you which can help you submit a better and a more meaningful report to the team While we value your insights on the technical points within the report, I would request you to segregate the technical findings and your insights into 2 different reports. This would help the team to easily identify the factual points and refer to your commentary for a detailed analysisI would also want you to structure your report in a better manner. Think and structure your thoughts before you start writing. Keep it short and simple and do not over complicate the report. Avoid jargons and pretentious words and be clear and direct. Finally you can get your report reviewed by a peer or your mentor before you submit the report. Lastly, I want you to be more committed and empowered to your deliverables.

I am confident that we will develop a plan that continues allow your work to help the program. Please meg me what time works best for you when you end your travel. Best, William",0,train,empathy,"Here is my analysis of the feedback email:

<reasoning>
Sentence 1: The opening is polite but generic, not showing much empathy or understanding of the employee's perspective.

Sentence 2: While the manager says the employee is important, the focus is on what ""we need"" from the employee rather than trying to see things from the employee's point of view. The phrasing ""your thoughts and Ideas are clearly communicated with helpful factual info"" implies the employee has not been communicating well, but doesn't give specific examples or acknowledge potential reasons for unclear communication.

Sentence 3: Asking for the employee's thoughts on how to best communicate is good, but the manager phrases it as ""how to communicate more concisely"" which presumes the employee has been too wordy rather than trying to understand their communication style or challenges.

Sentence 4: Setting a 48 hour deadline to meet and develop a plan comes across as a demand rather than a collaborative discussion. It puts pressure on the employee without much acknowledgement of their schedule or workload.

Sentence 5: Saying ""I am confident that we will develop a plan that continues allow your work to help the program"" focuses on the manager's goals for the program rather than working to truly understand and address the employee's needs and perspective. It assumes the employee's work is not currently helping the program.

Sentence 6: Ending with ""Please meg me what time works best for you when you end your travel"" shows some consideration of the employee's schedule, but still assumes the employee can meet within 48 hours without asking if that timeframe works for them.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email is an example of feedback that is not perspective-taking or encouraging because it fails to show true empathy and understanding of the employee's point of view. The manager makes assumptions about the employee's communication shortcomings without citing specifics or acknowledging potential challenges the employee faces. The language comes across as demanding, pressuring the employee to meet and change their communication style on the manager's terms and timeline. While the manager asks for the employee's thoughts, it's framed critically, implying the employee is too verbose rather than seeking to understand their perspective. The manager also focuses on their own goals and confidence about the employee changing to meet them, rather than working to truly understand the employee's needs and experiences. Overall, the tone is one of presuming the employee is at fault and must improve to meet the manager's standards, rather than finding an encouraging, mutually agreeable solution.

15,"Hello Jonathan, I will speak with Terry regarding the reports and make sure he knows what details to include. I am glad that he is finding the Beta project and all its applications to be so interesting and exciting. I will let him know we appreciate the effort he puts in but sometimes it is a little too much when we just need supporting facts for the report. If you are okay with it, I will show him some of your recent reports to coach on how they should be written so he has a better idea of what to include so there is not rework to be had. I would suggest working on the report together so you can discuss the amazing ways that the Beta project can be used so he isn't as inclined to include that in the report. We will discuss his goal of getting promoted to lead engineer and what steps he can take to ensure he gets where he wants. I would like to hear his thoughts on how the Beta project can be utilized across more areas and possibly how to incorporate them.

I understand that you want to move up in our organization, and this will go a long way towards showing us that you can do what's best for the company.

In general, the team is happy about your skills in contribution and espacially your way to identify improvements they may would have not seen. At first, your technical reports contain too much commentary that are not neccessary and make the report too long. Your ideas and thoughts about the technical solution are important, but you should only note them down separatly to discuss those with the project team, not to write them in the reports.Second is that your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be. to presennt this to customer or our CEO. This requires that the colleagues are correcting your work  what leads due to the high pressure to delays, which is embarassingfor the colleagues who commited end dates.It might be that you will be removed out of the project team Beta because of this. This is not to blame you, we just need to be more efficient in this urgent stage to provide the reports.As I know you are an ambitious employee and you want to do the best. I am also sure you want to be developped in a way that you are getting a lead engineer.  To achieve this target, we need to work on your skills in writing technical reports to only note down the required information. Your technical skiills are already on the required level.

Sentence 1: The opening is polite and sets context for the email, which is fine.

Sentence 2: Saying ""I became a feedback"" is an odd phrasing that sounds impersonal. It would be better to say something like ""I received some feedback..."" to be more direct.

Sentence 3: This sentence starts positively by praising Jonathan's skills and contributions. However, the phrasing ""they may would have not seen"" is grammatically incorrect and awkward.

Sentence 4: This sentence abruptly shifts to negative feedback without any transition or acknowledgment of Jonathan's perspective. Saying the reports ""contain too much commentary that are not neccessary"" comes across as blunt and critical.

Sentence 5: While this sentence explains what Jonathan should do differently, it does so in a commanding tone (""you should only..."") rather than engaging in a dialogue about different approaches.

Sentence 6: Saying ""your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be"" is a harsh judgment stated as fact, rather than an area for growth and improvement. It lacks any empathy for why Jonathan's writing may not meet expectations.

Sentence 7: This sentence says Jonathan's work is creating delays and embarrassment for his colleagues, which is a strong accusation to make without seeking to understand his perspective first. It assumes his intent is to cause problems for others.

Sentence 8: Threatening that Jonathan might be removed from the project team comes across as punitive and unsupportive. Saying ""This is not to blame you"" rings hollow given the critical tone of the previous sentences.

Sentence 9: Acknowledging Jonathan's ambition and desire to do his best is a positive note, but it gets lost among the many negative statements.

Sentence 10: Stating ""we need to work on your skills in writing technical reports"" presumes the manager knows the path forward, rather than inviting Jonathan's input on areas for development.

Sentence 11: This sentence repeats the positive feedback about Jonathan's technical skills, but it feels tacked on and insincere given the overall critical tone of the email.

Sentence 12: Suggesting a review process for Jonathan's work could be helpful, but it is presented as a mandate rather than a collaborative solution.

Sentence 13: Saying ""we need to check for courses to strengthen your skills"" again assumes the manager has the answers rather than engaging Jonathan in a dialogue about his development goals and needs.

Sentence 14: The closing sentences express some support and openness to further conversation, but they don't do enough to counterbalance the many critical and blameful statements earlier in the email.

</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email is an example of not-perspective taking and not-encouraging feedback because it fails to consider Jonathan's point of view, uses harsh and blameful language, and assumes the manager knows the solution without seeking Jonathan's input. The email jumps abruptly from positive to negative feedback without any transition or acknowledgment of Jonathan's perspective. It uses phrases like ""your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be"" and ""you might be removed from the project team"" which come across as unduly critical and threatening. While there are a few positive notes, like acknowledging Jonathan's technical skills and ambition, these get lost in the overall commanding and unsupportive tone of the email. To be more perspective-taking and encouraging, the feedback could invite dialogue about areas for improvement, ask questions to understand Jonathan's point of view, and engage him collaboratively in identifying next steps for his development.

32,"Hello Jonathan, I hope all is going well in my absence. Though your reports contain a lot of helpful information you need to dial it back to the technical specifics as you have to consider the audience you are generating these reports to being executive level management. The team has been having to review your reports pretty heavily and its consuming a lot of their time so please work with them to narrow down the reports to the pertinent information that is required based on their feedback and make sure to maintain those suggestions on future reports. I personally have struggled with information overload in my career but you have to be able to present the most detail you can in a short amount of space. Please work with Terry to dial in the report to what is pertinent and when I return we can work together to further enhance your reporting. Thanks and keep up the good work.",0,test,empathy,

18,"Hi Jonathan, Checking in to see how things are going on the Beta project. How are you enjoying working on the team?I'd like to highlight some areas of concerns where I think you can better support the team. You have a vast amount of knowledge that seems to be getting lost in the details of your reports.I have observed many of the reports have great details, but the facts are be overshadowed by opinion.  I'd like for you to frame your arguments more concisely by presenting the facts and including a brief recommendation based on the findings. Approaching the work this way will ensure your work packages have maximum effect. Please send me a reply back with any questions/concerns, and confirm you are committed to driving this change. I'd also like to review your next report before it is submitted to the team so I can provide more concrete feedback.As always, please feel free to raise any concerns you have.Thanks!

71,"Hi Jonathan, I wanted to thank you for your time and commitment to the Beta project.  I've heard good things pertaining to your technical reports but I wanted to bring up a couple of things that I think might make the reports more effective.  I noticed that the technical reports contained some opinions instead of facts.  Although your insight in appreciated, I believe it's more effective if we try to limit opinions from the reports.  My other suggestion would be more precise with the reports and try to limit details that might not be beneficial.  I can provide some resources in order to assist with this suggestion.  I believe this would not only benefit the reports for the Beta Project but will add another skill to your resume.  I really appreciate all the work that you've done so far and I hope that it will continue as this project moves along.  Can we set up a time later this week to review these suggestions and see if there are any other ways we can optimize the technical reports?  I hope to speak with your soon.

56,"Hi Jonathan, I have heard you are writing some thorough reports for the Beta project! We are happy to have someone with so much attention to detail working on this project. I know you aspire to be a lead engineer in the next year, so I want to provide you with a couple coaching tips that will help you achieve your goals:  Technical reports should only include facts. Your opinions are valued and I am happy that you are so eager to share your thoughts. Remember, though, the audience reading your technical reports are only concerned with the facts. Information must be presented in a concise, organized manner. Spending some extra time to organize your reports in a clear, easy to follow, manner will benefit the customers reading them. I am going send you a few examples of reports I have written that emphasize these two points. Keep these tips and the examples I send you in mind while writing your next report. I am happy to review your next report with you if you want more advice. Implementing these tips in your reports will improve your writing style and help you take the next jump to lead engineer.

62,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're well and the road is treating you well.I've received really positive feedback from Terry, he's been really impressed with your work ethic and he also mentioned you're coming up with improvement recommendation yourself!! Impressive!!I do however need you help with the way we're collecting the data, as you know these reports are being shared with the CEO and are also customer facing. So we must ensure that when these reports are submitted they should only include the facts and if you have some personal views, you can still share them but not in these reports. You will have to share your opinions separately, as we do value your input, but cannot include them in the reports.We also need to work on your layout when putting these reports together to ensure that they are easy to read and the reader gets all the information you are providing. I understand this isnt human nature to a lot of people and its just something we need to support you with, so going forward you need to have either myself (if I'm around) or someone else review them to ensure the reports reflects the best possible outcome for you and the business. I'm keen to see you succeed and this will be valuable development for you as an individual, especially one day if you were interested in stepping up to a lead engineer position once one became available, this is the sort of development and support you could pass on to junior engineers.Let me know if this makes sense and if you have any concerns.

Your insights have been very helpful with regard to the necessary improvements.  However, I have received a few pieces of feedback on your work that I would like to share to benefit your efforts.The team here is having challenges with deciphering your technical information and facts from your own personal perspectives on the findings.  While your personal perspective is important, in order to showcase your work efficiently for senior management and our customers, I will need you to work on editing your personal commentary and stating your key message and findings at the top of your reports.I have also received feedback that your reports are unorganized.  It is important to make sure you heavily edit your work before sending it back, so the team is well aware of the most crucial information to share with senior management and our customers.  It is unfortunately taking the team here too much time to go through your reports which is causing them to be late.  Please work on reviewing your reports and making sure the most important information is highlighted in a way that someone could easily review it within a couple of minutes.I hope this information has been helpful.

I've been getting feed back that you have been a good contributor and that everyone on the team likes you. Good job. I did want to speak to you about your reports though, I have gotten some feed back that your reports can be long and offer a lot of opinions when sometimes it's better to stick to the facts. I have read through some of them myself and have to agree. I would ask you to keep your reports to the facts and organized thoughts throughout. Okay? I know you are still fairly new to the business world so am going to work with you through the next couple of reports to ensure you understand what I'm looking for and after that I'll have you copy me with your reports as well.

Reports you have submitted thus far have had to beedited forclarity as too much time was being spent looking for the needed points.

I am aware that business writing is not something you have been formally trained on, so I have booked time for you to take a seminar on it to be completed before your next report is due. I understand that you have a passion for this work, however, we need the report to be technically sound and to keep our own personal opinions out of the equation, by focusing on the facts. I learned to utilize the inverted pyramid style when writing, by placing all the important topics at the top and then further along going into detail.

He also shared some concerns he had about the written reports you had submitted to him.

Since the reports are critical and time-bound, it is imperative that they are concise and contain minimal commentary.

Have you considered reviewing the content of these to ensure only the information that is required is being documented? It's great to see how excited you are about learning during this project.

Our goal for this program was to have you travel and gather information for technical reports.The technical reports are  given to senior leadership or to our prospective customers and need to be clear and concise. It is has been brought to my attention that your reports,although very detailed, contain too main perspectives and opinions. Due to the audience these reports are being delivered to it is extremely important we separate facts from opinions.I am hoping this message is clear in what I am asking.

Regards, William",1,train,empathy,"Here is my analysis of the feedback email:

<reasoning>
Sentence 1: ""Hi Jonathan, Good to hear you are enjoying the work."" - This opening sentence is positive and encouraging, expressing happiness that Jonathan is enjoying his job.

Sentence 2: ""I would like to discuss with you feedback on your assignment and the reports you are producing."" - The manager takes Jonathan's perspective by wanting to discuss the feedback with him directly. This allows for a two-way conversation rather than just telling Jonathan what to do.

Sentence 3: ""It is very important to understand the stakeholders who will be reading your report."" - This sentence encourages Jonathan to think from the perspective of the report audience. It explains why the feedback is important.

Sentence 4: ""You may have gathered a lot of good information BUT do not put them all on your reports."" - While this sentence includes constructive criticism, the word ""BUT"" is capitalized, adding emphasis in an encouraging rather than harsh way. It acknowledges Jonathan gathered good information.

Sentence 5: ""The report should state facts and not your opinions."" - This clearly explains what Jonathan should focus on in an objective tone. It's instructive without being overly critical.

Sentence 6: ""Create reports for the purpose and for the audience."" - This encourages Jonathan to think about the perspective and needs of others when creating his reports. It's advising rather than dictating.

Sentence 7: ""I would also suggest that you reach out to Terry to understand what information is needed on the reports you produce."" - The manager offers a helpful suggestion of talking to a colleague while still leaving it up to Jonathan to take that initiative. This encourages Jonathan's growth and shows trust in him.

Sentence 8: ""Having said that, the additional insights you gathered are very important too."" - This sentence shifts to praising Jonathan and affirming the value of the extra information he gathered. It's very encouraging after the constructive feedback.

Sentence 9: ""Please add them to our knowledge repository and share with the team."" - The manager encourages Jonathan to share his insights with the team. This shows the manager thinks Jonathan's perspective is valuable for others to learn from.

It takes Jonathan's perspective, noting how channeling his insights benefits himself and the organization.

Sentence 12: ""I would encourage you to enroll for the business writing training course."" - The manager suggests a constructive next step for Jonathan to improve his writing. ""Encourage"" is a supportive word that makes this feel optional.

Sentence 13: ""Please choose a date from the learning calendar and let me know."" - This closes with a clear request while still letting Jonathan choose the date, which empowers him with some control. It keeps the overall tone encouraging.

</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email is an excellent example of perspective taking and encouraging feedback for several key reasons.

In reviewing the updates, it appears there are some opportunities for improvement with the preparation of the technical and business reports. I appreciate you pushing to get these reports done and completed in a timely fashion, but we also need to work to ensure we are meeting the expectations of the team and leadership. At this time we need to improve in the areas of being clear, concise, and accurate in the reports that are provided to the Beta team. I would like for you to take some time and review the following questions and provide feedback tomorrow afternoon:Technical Reports - Am I providing the data and technical information or my opinion?Technical Reports - What is leadership looking for and what do they need to make a decision?Technical Reports - What does good look like?

55,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are well?It has been brought to my attention that we are having issues with the technical report writing on the Beta Project, which I am hoping you can help correct and resolve? There are two main issues as shown below: Additional Commentary which are opinion based and not necessarily just focused on the facts. This makes the reports very difficult to digest and summarize.Lack of organization which requires additional re-work before being passed onto the CEO or prospective customer. In order to improve this, I will ask Terry to provide you with additional feedback which I am requesting you take on board for the future report writing. There are several reports coming up and if we make these changes now, it will help the team meeting the deadlines moving forward.If you feel like you need additional training on report writing please let me know? Please take this as positive feedback and continue with your enthusiasm on the Beta Project. Kind Regards William",0,dev,empathy,
74,"Jonathan, I just touched base with Terry on the Beta Project and wanted to reach out. This is a great opportunity that senior leadership will be able to see and can really open up doors for you. Because I've worked with senior leadership so much, I know what information they need and what insights, while helpful, is not what they want.Your passion for your job, and being a true team player is why you are so like-able on the team, and everyone appreciates your efforts. However, because this is for senior leaders these reports need to be concise. I struggle with this problem myself - but in order to be moved up to Senior Engineer you will have to adjust your writing to be clear, concise and organized. I will have Terry send you examples of previous business writing. This may give you a better idea of how your reports should be structured. Remember that the C-level people will be reading this, and they are all very factual. This is a great opportunity to show your flexibility and adaptability in your skills and will catapult you to the next step.Terry did mentioned that you have identified improvements that the team didn't even know they needed!  Please keep up the good work - but remember, keep the commentary for discussion, and the facts for the writing. Thank you! ",0,test,empathy,
177,"Hello Jonathan, I hope your traveling is going well and there are no issues.  Jonathan I am writing to discuss the Beta Project technical reports you have been submitting to Terry.   Overall I want to thank you for all the work you are putting into writing the reports. But please accept these things to consider when turning them in, in the future.  The purpose of the reports are of a technical nature, therefore you should focus on that aspect.  These reports are submitted to perspective customers and the CEO are should just stick to the technical aspects of the Beta project, and should be limited on opinions.  These changes will help you streamline these reports as well as cut down the time that it takes you to produce them. I believe if you stick to the technical aspects of the report it would benefit you in a major way.   Please let me know if there are any issues with the creation of these reports and I will gladly help you with any questions you have.  We really appreciate the work that you have been putting in, but need these reports to be streamlined so that they will be easier to read and more appropriate to present to the CEO. Thank you. And I hope you have a great evening. ",0,dev,empathy,
107,"Hi there Jonathan, I hope you're doing well and are staying safe out there on the road! I wanted to touch base with you regarding your efforts on the Beta project. I can tell you that your enthusiasm for the project has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated! Passion for what we're doing makes all the difference, and your passion is clear! That being said, I want to review your contributions to date with the team and offer some insight on how we can perhaps tighten things up a bit; we don't want your messaging to be lost in your overall enthusiasm for the task at hand! 1) You need to be concise; I can tell by what I've reviewed that you have a real passion for the Beta project, and that is fantastic! The only issue is that sometimes the facts of the matter get lost in our own opinions. Less feelings, more facts is my motto!  I'd suggest reviewing your thoughts and feelings about the facts with me in our 1-on-1's and I'm more than happy to listen! 2) Point form is your friend. I would suggest making a draft copy of your findings in point form, and then condensing that even more when you place them in order from most urgent/pressing to least. This will ensure the meatier items aren't left for last, and that the real core of the messaging is properly received. I am confident you will step up to the challenge and embrace the change, just as you have in the past! Adaptability is a very strong asset; it will do you well in your career aspirations! Thank you, William",0,dev,empathy,
