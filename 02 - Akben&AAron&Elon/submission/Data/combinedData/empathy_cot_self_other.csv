87,"Jonathan, I am glad to hear that you are enjoying your work on the Beta project. Based on feed back on past reports, I need to make some suggestions forthis next report and future reports. It is important that you realize thepurpose of your report and theimportance of getting the key informationexplained. Length of the reportdoes not increase it's value. For you next report, please make some changes in your process. I suggest making an outline of key points that showcase the important ideas you are trying to communicate. Your enthusiasm is great but will be better shown by organizing the technical points that need to be shared. Your insights and opinions should not be part of a fact sheet about the project. Pleaseemail meyour next report so we may discuss the format as moving forward the reports need to follow a more concise format. Of course, this means that you will need to work on this next report quickly so that you will be able to submit it to Terry on time. I appreciate your contribution to the Beta project and look forward to seeing that report.",0,dev,empathy,
16,"Jonathan, Due to your traveling, we are unable to connect by video.  I am in the office for one day to catch up and resolve issues among our team progress/processes.  I hear you are very excited to be part of the team and working on the Beta Project- this is exactly what ABC-5 looks for- engagement of our members.  I would like to have a discussion regarding feedback on the reports you have submitted.  The expectation of the reports are to be objective in nature and contain only technical information.  From the feedback, the readers find it difficult to separate facts from opinion, lots of unnecessary commentary which prevents the reader from identifying the major points.    I would like to offer you a business writing course offered by ABC-5.  This course assists our employees on how to write a business plan with key elements.Please let me know when you have taken the course.  Until then, I would suggest  having one of your team members review the reports prior to submission.  I know you will be receptive to this suggestion as you are valued on our team. William",0,test,empathy,
155,"Hi Jonathan, I trust that you are doing good and enjoying all the travelling.Well, I have reviewed the report reports that you have been sharing all this while and have also discussed with Terry about the usability of the same. Couple of things that I wanted to shared with you are mentioned below, unfortunately since we could not connect personally I am listing them down. It is great that you have so much information about so many products but it would be better if you limit the size of the report. From reader's perspective it becomes really overwhelming to read so much and derive a useful conclusion out of it. You can keep noting down your observations in another document and probably after this project we can circulate it to relevant stakeholders!I saw your message, and i could see that you are quite eager to explore new opportunities and collect as much information as possible. Would just suggest that for now you only focus on doing your work best possible way, promotion and payhike will come to you eventually basis your performance.I would also like to understand in case you are facing any issue in incorporating above feedbacks, so that we as team can work towards making these reports more  useful for Terry and his team.Let us work together towards this endeavor.Thanks, William",0,dev,empathy,
117,"Hi Jonathan,I hope your travels are going well! I received some feedback regarding your work on the Beta project that I would like your help in solutioning. I understand that you are really excited and enjoy working on the Beta Project, and we are really excited to have your energy! However, I want to make sure that we are making best use of your energy in moving in a helpful direction for the team. Specifically, I'd like to focus on making the reports more concise and structured in our standard way - and then put your extra ideas and efforts towards additional research initiatives.  I understand that you have lots of ideas and comments around the research that you're doing. For the reports, however, We need the reports to remain as streamlined and consistent as possible to ensure that our consolidated report works smoothly. As a result, I would like you to schedule a meeting with Terry to cover the following items: Review the report format. I know that you are new to the team, and this is a great learning opportunity to make sure that only the facts are included in the report that are required.Ask Terry about additional ways to provide your ideas. Perhaps hold a weekly discussion to review the information and provide your colored commentary. Terry will have additional ideas that you two can discuss. Before submitting your report this week, please also ask for a peer review from one of your co-workers. This is a great opportunity for you to meet and learn additional tips and tricks from your colleagues. Please send me a note and let me know how these things go. I look forward to hearing the solutions you come up with. I want to support you in your growth at this company, and look forward to partnering with you. Warm Regards, William",0,test,empathy,

I have noticed that reports are coming in late and require a lot of rework before sending them out to senior management.We have work to do on getting you the support to go through all the data and selecting the relevant information to aid decision making for senior management.

As you may have known by now in your current role you have a huge opportunity for learning and growth. Given that your experience in business writing is less, you developed of self interest in the report writing and you are doing a good job. In the series of this I also noticed that there are couple of areas where you can improve yourself. While you write the reports lets keep the content precise and clear. The reports that you create are presented to the stakeholders and CEO. It reflects the quality of work you do, I have no doubt in the good work that you do but while putting your knowledge or information gained, in writing you should ensure that the reader is able to differentiate the importance of information.

120,"Jonathan, I am reaching out to discuss your work on the Beta Project while I have been away. I am hearing good feedback from your team on your contribution, thank you for that. I would like to discuss 2 ways which will continue to lead to a positive experience in your contribution. The first is around how to help you efficiently capture your commentary, which in turn will help save you time.  We are all very busy, including yourself so the more concise our commentary, the increased likelihood of our colleagues understanding the information.   The second is helping you create your messages in an cohesive manner, which will help them be easy to read and understand.  This will also help your commentary to be consistent with your colleagues, which will ensure better understanding from customers, as well as internal stakeholders.I would like to partner you up with a tenured employee, Molly, to review how she compiles her commentary in reports.  Upon completion please send over any key learning and how you will incorporate the leanings in your reports. Again thank you for all you do.

Currently, they include a lot of details which are not always necessary. Please focus on the most important points and use the project meetings to address any points of improvement or general inputs.Another point is the writing.

106,"Hi Jonathan, just wanted to discuss the reports you've been submitting on the Beta Project whilst travelling. You mention that it has been challenging whilst travelling, and this certainly can be tricky to manage the time. How are you finding this and is there any help I can assist with on this front? I always find that good reports are short, to the point and convey the most important facts about the data. Additional commentary can often make writing these reports longer than they need to be and ultimately we all have time deadlines to meet. The data on these reports are the most important details to gather and report back on. Would I be able to send over some examples of really good reports and quickly run through the best features of these. As you can now attest to, managing our time on these reports isn't always easy but if we can make these more concise then it really helps everyone else in the team and helps you to stand out. I think at the moment and based on some of the reports submitted so far, there is a great potential to benefit from this exercise.Because of the time pressure on this project we will need to keep checking on these and if you need assistance on anything please don't hesitate to ask.

122,"Hello Jonathan, I am writing in regards to the technical reports that you submit using the information you are collecting.  Your reports are extremely detailed and provide all of the data needed to make decisions, and your insights and conclusions are well thought out.  However, as these are technical reports, it is always a good idea to separate the facts and data from personal conclusions, to allow others to draw their own conclusions from the information provided.  From what I've heard, there is a lot to be gained from your experience and first hand knowledge.  I would suggest that you include your comments and ideas in a separate appendix to your report.  This would allow reviewers to gain the main points of the report, but also allow them the opportunity review your conclusions on the data.  Also, providing a more concise report allows others to draw their own conclusions, and they are then able to contact you, personally, if they would like more information on the subject. I know that business writing can be a daunting task, and we've all had to learn ways to get our thoughts down in a way that is both professional and easily understood.  I know I have!

40,"Hi Jonathan. First of all, thanks for helping out with the Beta project. You have helped us identify improvements that even we didnt know we needed. Now that you have become a seasoned contributor, it is time to up your game. To do that, you can work on 2 major improvement areas of your report for which I have received feedback from your team. The first is that you need to make your reports concise. I understand that you like to provide valuable insights but it becomes difficult to take the main points out of the report. What you can do is that you can keep the insights in an annexure This would keep the core of the report intact and would also enable us to go through your valuable insights.Also though your reports are filled with insights, it is important to also structure them properly so that they can be sent to the management directly without much review. It will only enable you to perform at your peak. I believe if you improve on the above 2 items, you would definitely take your performance to the next level and which would further your career growth in the years to come. I can help you in finding a mentor/ attend training programs to improve your skills. Please feel free to call/ message me for a detailed conversation or if you need my guidance.",0,dev,empathy,

I have received feedback that your report can be structured bettter and be more focused on the findings. To ensure that your report is creating the right impact, i feel that it will help if you can do a survey / take feedback from your stakeholders on the report structure and related aspects like length, language, exhibits, fact representation etc. This will help customize your work to what your stakeholders really need and help you in the process!

Sentence 12: ""Can I have your words that you will write a good report?"" - This question pressures the employee to commit without addressing their concerns or offering support.

The language is directive and focused on what the employee should do to meet the writer's standards, rather than offering constructive guidance or collaborative problem-solving. The tone is authoritative and pressures the employee to commit to deadlines and deliverables without addressing their concerns or providing adequate support.

Throughout the email, the writer emphasizes how the employee's actions affect the team's productivity and the company's success, but fails to consider the employee's perspective or individual needs. The feedback is more concerned with the format and timeline of the reports than with helping the employee improve their skills or feel valued. Overall, the self-centered nature of this feedback undermines its effectiveness and may leave the employee feeling unsupported and unappreciated.

First of all I love the passion you put into your work and it seems as if you are really enjoying your experiences and learning new things.  I had an opportunity to review some of your reports and I wanted to offer some feedback.  When writing your reports, let's leave factual information in the reports and separate your opinions from the facts, this will allow your peers and others to decipher the information require quickly and clearly.  Please make sure your reports are structured and organized.  I would suggest outlining all the pertinent information at the top of your reports and adding in any comments you would like to add towards the bottom.  I would suggest reaching out to your peers for suggestions and idea on how to structure the reports to make them simple and professional to present to managers, a lot of your peers have good experience in this area.   Please send your next report to me to review before submitted, I'd like an opportunity to review your improvements and offer some feedback.  If there is anything I could do to better support you please let me know.  You're doing great and keep that passion going, really important to the business and we can feel the energy in the reports. Thanks",0,test,empathy,

Sentence 1: ""Hi Jonathan, How are You doing with the Beta project? It seams You are very exited about the project."" - The feedback starts with a focus on the writer's perception of Jonathan's excitement, rather than directly addressing Jonathan's progress or work on the project.

Sentence 2: ""There are two topics that I want to point out that I expct to be Your focus on this project."" - The writer emphasizes their own expectations and what they want Jonathan to focus on, rather than collaborating or asking for Jonathan's input.

Sentence 3: ""I review the latest report and saw that in addition to a tchnical information that we have agreed to be included in that, there is a lots of commentaries from Your side."" - The writer highlights their own review of the report and implies that Jonathan's commentaries are not in line with what was agreed upon, focusing on the writer's perspective.

Sentence 4: ""It is greeate that You see the opportunities and perspectives on the findings but I ask You to focus on collecting and passing on the technical information according to the agreed template."" - While acknowledging Jonathan's insights, the writer quickly shifts the focus back to their own request and the agreed template, minimizing the importance of Jonathan's contributions.

Sentence 5: ""We can focus on Your ideas separately once the Beta gets to that stage."" - The writer suggests discussing Jonathan's ideas later, prioritizing their own timeline and goals over Jonathan's input.

Sentence 6: ""The second thing I'd like you to focus is the organizing the details in the reports."" - Again, the writer dictates what they want Jonathan to focus on, without seeking Jonathan's thoughts or collaboration.

Sentence 7: ""Please work together with Terry on that."" - The writer instructs Jonathan to work with Terry, without providing context or considering Jonathan's existing workload or relationships.

Sentence 8: ""As the deadlines for presenting the reports to CEO are quite challenging, they have lost of hints and tricks how to make the report informative and easy to read."" - The writer emphasizes the challenging deadlines and the importance of presenting to the CEO, focusing on their own concerns and priorities.

Sentence 9: ""I've have used his experience and competence myself."" - The writer highlights their own experience working with Terry, implying that Jonathan should follow their lead and trust their judgment.

Sentence 10: ""It is very important that we submit the report on time."" - The writer stresses the importance of meeting deadlines, prioritizing their own goals over any concerns or input Jonathan may have.

Sentence 11: ""Please add me as well to the reciepient list once You send the infotmation to Terry."" - The writer asks to be included in communications, demonstrating a desire to maintain control and oversight.

Sentence 12: ""Good luck!"" - While meant as encouragement, this closing remark does not address any of Jonathan's potential concerns or feelings about the feedback provided.

<analysis>
This email is an example of self-centric feedback because the writer consistently prioritizes their own expectations, goals, and perspectives over those of the employee, Jonathan. Throughout the email, the writer dictates what they want Jonathan to focus on, without seeking his input or considering his ideas and contributions. The writer's language emphasizes their own review of the report, their expectations for the project, and their experience working with another team member, Terry.

The feedback does not create a collaborative or supportive environment; instead, it focuses on the writer's concerns about meeting deadlines and presenting to the CEO. The writer's instructions and requests are presented as non-negotiable, leaving little room for Jonathan to express his thoughts or concerns. Overall, the tone of the email is directive and self-centered, with the writer's priorities and opinions taking precedence over Jonathan's professional growth and contributions to the project.

14,"Hi Jonathan: I hope you are doing great. Thank you for all the excellent work you are doing and appreciate all the passion you exhibit to get the work done. I want to bring out few points to get more impact on findings you do. Hence my suggestion for you would be following. Once you create the reports, I would like you to go through two three times to look at ares where you can bring in refinement, so that it is crisp and concise. As you know our customers and senior leaderships would love to get most important points/snippets when they read reports. Hence it is important that we give them concise reports which will create first impression and hit on the important points.I think if you can do this, you will improve your research quality and report quality, and bring in a new dimension to your overall skills - which is consulting. That would be an awesome skill to acquire and that would give you tremendous opportunities to grow. At the end of the day, we work to make our customers happy and if our customers are happy with quality of the content we provide, we as a team grow exponentially. I would also suggest to work more collaboratively, seek feedbacks from seniors/peers which will only improve your work. We all come with a view, but it is ok to get another view and weigh in every option to decide the best. We all learn from each other and that make us a better person. Let me know if the above make sense. I will be happy to get into a meeting when you are available to discuss this further. Looking forward to your continuous contribution.",0,test,empathy,

But, at the same time they are not able to meet deadlines due to your expressive and exciting thoughts.

I am committing myself to personally teach you Business writing in addition to making you to go through the e-learning programs on the same. Similarly, I need a commitment from you to adhere to the deadlines and reduce the expressive thoughts and be precise in your insights generation.Sometimes, too many insights also will make the solution more difficult and delay in execution. You provide which are your best 2-3 options/insights for the execution and use the other time to focus on business writing. It will be a win-win for both of us.This will also ensure your are not only technically knowledgeable but also good in writing which will help you to move up the career.Once I am back, let's see the progress.

<analysis>
This email is an excellent example of other-centric feedback because it consistently prioritizes the employee's well-being, growth, and success. The manager demonstrates genuine concern for the employee, acknowledges their progress, and provides constructive feedback in a supportive manner. By attributing the feedback to a third party (Terry) and offering solutions and personal assistance, the manager maintains a collaborative and growth-oriented approach. The email's tone remains professional, supportive, and empathetic throughout, focusing on aligning expectations and helping the employee succeed rather than criticizing their shortcomings. These key elements - concern for the employee, constructive feedback, collaborative problem-solving, and a supportive tone - make this email a clear example of other-centric feedback.

First off I want to say that the team feels that you are a good contributor and that you identify improvement opportunities but they are struggling with a couple of your work habits. The first is that you include too much commentary in your reports. Your reports should contain only technical information and not your perspectives. Going forward you need to improve this and stick to the facts. In addition to this you need to focus on the organization of your reports. Your reports influence some important decisions at ABC-5 and should be the best reflection of your capabilities every time. When your reports are not concise and accurate then they have to be edited by a team member. Because of this feedback I am asking you to think of ways that you can improve your reports and writing skills. Please send them to me by EOB tomorrow and I would also like your commitment that you will work with me to find alternate ways to improve in these areas such as mentoring with a team member that is a great report writter or additional training etc. If you want to stay on the team it is necessary that you improve in both of these areas and I will support you in developing and implementation of an improvement plan over the next 30 days.

I have spoken with your team members and they have said you are passionate about your role at ABC-5 and have good improvement ideas for the team.

It's difficult to decipher the true content of the report versus your added commentary. There are some educational modules I'd like you to take to help you with business writing. This should help provide you with a foundation to help you move forward in your role and gain confidence and trust among your team and our customers at ABC-5. I'm only available today and then will be away at an assignment for two more weeks. I'd like to set up weekly meetings with you when I return from my assignment.

In general, the team is happy about your skills in contribution and espacially your way to identify improvements they may would have not seen. At first, your technical reports contain too much commentary that are not neccessary and make the report too long. Your ideas and thoughts about the technical solution are important, but you should only note them down separatly to discuss those with the project team, not to write them in the reports.Second is that your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be. to presennt this to customer or our CEO. This requires that the colleagues are correcting your work  what leads due to the high pressure to delays, which is embarassingfor the colleagues who commited end dates.It might be that you will be removed out of the project team Beta because of this. This is not to blame you, we just need to be more efficient in this urgent stage to provide the reports.As I know you are an ambitious employee and you want to do the best. I am also sure you want to be developped in a way that you are getting a lead engineer.  To achieve this target, we need to work on your skills in writing technical reports to only note down the required information. Your technical skiills are already on the required level. In addition, the usiness writing is a topic that we can work on.At first we can agree that you send me each chapter that you finalized so that I can have a review before submitting all to Terry. In addition, we need to check for courses to strengthen you rskills in writing reports as I also want to continue working with you.

Sentence 1: The email begins with a standard greeting and explains the reason for contacting via email. This sentence is neutral and does not contribute to the self-centric nature of the feedback.

Sentence 2: William mentions that he received feedback from others about Jonathan's reports, which suggests that the focus is on William's perspective and the impact on him, rather than directly addressing Jonathan's performance.

Sentence 3: While this sentence acknowledges Jonathan's skills and contributions, it is framed from the perspective of the team's happiness, not directly praising Jonathan.

Sentence 4: William points out that Jonathan's reports contain unnecessary commentary, which is a valid concern. However, the phrasing ""too much"" and ""not necessary"" emphasizes William's judgment without providing constructive suggestions.

Sentence 5: William acknowledges the importance of Jonathan's ideas but instructs him to note them down separately. This sentence focuses on William's preferences rather than explaining the reasons behind the suggestion.

Sentence 6: William states that Jonathan's technical writing level is not meeting the required standard, which is a legitimate concern. However, the phrasing ""not on the level it is required to be"" emphasizes William's expectations without offering guidance on how to improve.

Sentence 7: William mentions that colleagues are correcting Jonathan's work, leading to delays and embarrassment. This sentence shifts the focus to the impact on colleagues and the company, rather than addressing Jonathan's development needs.

Sentence 8: The possibility of removing Jonathan from the project team is presented as a consequence of his performance, but William frames it as ""not to blame"" Jonathan, which comes across as insincere.

Sentence 9: William acknowledges Jonathan's ambition and desire to do his best, but the phrasing ""I am also sure you want to be developed in a way that you are getting a lead engineer"" assumes Jonathan's goals without directly asking him.

Sentence 10: William reiterates the need to work on Jonathan's technical report writing skills, emphasizing what William believes is required for Jonathan's development, rather than collaborating with Jonathan to identify areas for improvement.

Sentence 11: The suggestion of reviewing each chapter before submission to Terry focuses on William's involvement and control over Jonathan's work, rather than fostering Jonathan's autonomy and growth.

Sentence 12: While offering to find courses to strengthen Jonathan's skills is a positive step, the phrasing ""I also want to continue working with you"" centers William's desires rather than Jonathan's development.

Sentence 13: William mentions seeing high potential in Jonathan but frames the development direction as something ""we need to sit together"" to decide, which may not fully consider Jonathan's own aspirations.

Sentence 14: The email concludes with a friendly wish for a safe travel and an offer to discuss further, which is a positive gesture but does not mitigate the self-centric nature of the overall feedback.

<analysis>
The email feedback provided by William to Jonathan is self-centric because it primarily focuses on William's perspective, judgments, and the impact of Jonathan's performance on William and the company. Throughout the email, William emphasizes his own expectations, preferences, and desires, rather than centering the feedback on Jonathan's growth and development needs. The language used often highlights William's authority and control, such as instructing Jonathan on what to do and assuming his goals without direct consultation. While some of the concerns raised are valid, the feedback lacks a collaborative and empowering tone that would encourage Jonathan to take ownership of his development. Instead, the email suggests that William will dictate the direction of Jonathan's growth, which is a self-centric approach to providing feedback.

This contributes to the self-centric nature of the email.

Sentence 4: ""I want to get your thoughts on how you best communicate and your thoughts on how to communicate more concisely."" - Although the writer is asking for the employee's thoughts, the phrasing ""I want"" makes it more about the writer's desires than a genuine interest in the employee's perspective.

Sentence 5: ""Please come up with 2-3 suggestions as will I and lets set up a time within the next 48 hours that you and I can build a plan that will help ensure your great work is being understood for the success of Beta."" - This sentence is directive and focuses on the writer's plan and timeline. It assumes that the employee's work is not being understood, without first seeking their input. This contributes to the self-centric nature of the email.

Sentence 6: ""I am confident that we will develop a plan that continues allow your work to help the program."" - This sentence emphasizes the writer's confidence and assumes that the employee's work is not currently helping the program effectively. It comes across as self-centric by not acknowledging the employee's current contributions.

Sentence 7: ""Please meg me what time works best for you when you end your travel."" - This final sentence is more neutral and does not significantly contribute to the self-centric tone.

That being said, I want to review your contributions to date with the team and offer some insight on how we can perhaps tighten things up a bit; we don't want your messaging to be lost in your overall enthusiasm for the task at hand! 1) You need to be concise; I can tell by what I've reviewed that you have a real passion for the Beta project, and that is fantastic! The only issue is that sometimes the facts of the matter get lost in our own opinions. Less feelings, more facts is my motto!  I'd suggest reviewing your thoughts and feelings about the facts with me in our 1-on-1's and I'm more than happy to listen! 2) Point form is your friend. I would suggest making a draft copy of your findings in point form, and then condensing that even more when you place them in order from most urgent/pressing to least. This will ensure the meatier items aren't left for last, and that the real core of the messaging is properly received. I am confident you will step up to the challenge and embrace the change, just as you have in the past! Adaptability is a very strong asset; it will do you well in your career aspirations! Thank you, William",0,dev,empathy,

As i have not been able to connect with you personally, thought of e-mailing a few areas you could focus on to develop further and effectively contribute. I have also collected feedback from team members on the project and recommend these next steps. Significance of Reports: The reports you prepare are tabled with the leadership and support decision making. Hence need to be concise and precise. This could be an area for you to develop further given your aspirationsAction: Would suggest you present the report in 2 sections: FACTs and Your Suggestions/Opinions. This will enable them to understand the facts objectively and judge your thoughts better Development: As your job entails a significant amount of report writing, i highly recommend you to take up a learning course on executive business repiort writing. I shall take this up with the HR team and nominate you for the best course on the subject. Progress: Let us set-up a monthly check-in to monitor your development and for you also to share any feedback. Regards William",0,test,empathy,

Thanks for all your efforts on the reports so far, however you like to share some feedback on the reports so that they can be more direct and to the point. Please keep the following things in mind while you write a report: Keep Facts and opinion separate and only mention the technical information in the report. This would help the reports to be shorter and up to the point. By this I do not mean that we do not appreciate the insights given by you but report is not the right place to give your insights and perceptive.

I know that others have been helping to organization, edit, and re-write some of the report before passing it along to prospective customers or internal managers, so I'd like you to take more of a role in making sure your reports are summarized in a way that can really illustrate your findings. I'll attach some good example reports, so please take a look at them and write down questions/ comments, so that when I return,we can discuss any questions you have when I return.

The team is happy with your improvement suggestions, genuine enthusiasm for the project, and everyone really likes working with you.  I appreciate your commitment, and I know that travel isn't always easy.  Terry has shared some of your reporting techniques with me. While we appreciate your insights and attention to detail, we are going to need you to shift gears a little to help the team make their deadlines.  It is difficult for the team to easily separate facts from opinions in your reports, and it would be much easier for them to pass on the great information you're sharing if your reports were more concise and organized.I know this change in work habit might be a challenge for you, but it is imperative for the success of the project.  That being said, I've come up with a game plan for getting your reports to where the team needs them to be for success.  Terry has a lot of experience in business writing, and since he is responsible for passing on your reports to customers and our executive leadership team, I've asked him to sit with you for a couple of hours this week to share some of his edits on your previous reports. This is not in any way a negative exercise, and I really believe it will help both you and the team throughout the project.  Please take this opportunity as a learning experience, and reach out to Terry ASAP to schedule the time! Please shoot me a note with your thoughts on this, and let me know if you have any additional ideas on how to further improve the Beta project reporting.

98,"Hi Jonathan, How are you recently? I heard that you have been working with Terry recently on the Beta project and have been busy traveling to gathering information for your technical reports. I have also read some of the reports that you have submitted, and I'm surprised how much information you can gather within such short periods of time and there also some good suggestions to help the team improve! However, sometimes too much information might be overwhelming for the reader as well. Here are some suggestions that can consider when writing your next report. Try to summarize your report and focus on technical information first. You can separately draft your opinions and recommendations in another report to be submitted to Terry. Your reports also have to be reviewed by other team members, so do take note on the timeline and give sufficient time to the rest so that we can achieve the timeline as a team. I have also attached some great technical reports here, hope they would help with your upcoming technical reports and Terry would also be able to provide further training if necessary.

I recommend that for this project you carefully listen to the direction of the project lead and inquire as to what information that they are hoping to see from your reports.

I realize that you have gained a tremendous amount of insight from traveling to gather the data, but going forward we need to make sure that only facts are input into this report and not your personal opinions on these matters.

I also sense that you are really motivated by this project and is looking forward to leveraging this project to gain a promotion to lead engineer. In order for your reports to add value to the project and the teams, I would like to highlight these areas of improvement: Clear and concise report. For reports to be easily and quickly understood, it has to be concise and contain only technical information. We noticed that the reports that you submitted consists of both information and opinions. This results in a much longer report than required. Organisation of the report. Organise the report in a logical and structured manner will help your readers understand what you are trying to say. Consider the amount of details in the report, so that the information that you present is meaningful to the reader.With this in mind, how can you change your reporting layout/structure to make it better for our audiences?

In such high-profile projects like this one, as much as the process of gathering information , going deep into understanding whats happening is important, how the findings are presented especially to the senior leadership is equally important. It is critical that when you submit reports for the project, you clearly distinguish between the facts and what your opinions and insights are. I also want you to take up a course of business writing so that your findings in the reports come out to be more articulate.

I would like to help you be more valuable to the team to make sure you have a shot at that promotion you are looking for.First, please seek out a business writing course. You can contact HR to inquire about available company resources. If ABC-5 does not offer a course I would ask that you research outside sources. This will give you an opportunity to improve yourself and be more valuable to the company as a whole.Second, until you have completed that course please keep your reports fact based. Your valuable commentary and opinions can be submitted via email or as an addendum of the report, but do not include it in the reporting document. This will help the team to quickly decipher the information and be able to report up to the steering committee. this approach will help the team greatly, but also give you the opportunity to provide feedback. Third, I would like you to follow up with me in a month to let me know how the business writing course has helped you. I would love to understand the value of the course you took so that we can assess it as a development tool for the rest of the team. Jonathan, understand that the Beta program is very important and you are a valuable team member. Also understand that you following reporting guidelines is imperative.

Sentence 1: ""Hi Jonathan, and I hope your travels are going well."" - This opening sentence is neutral and does not significantly contribute to the email being self-centric or other-centric.

Sentence 2: ""As soon as you get a chance, I would like to catch up on the reports you are creating for the Beta projects."" - The focus here is on what the sender wants (""I would like to catch up""), making it slightly self-centric. However, it also acknowledges the employee's work on the Beta projects.

Sentence 3: ""Your contributions have been fantastic, but we need to limit the commentary and make them more concise."" - While the sender recognizes the employee's ""fantastic"" contributions, the use of ""we need to"" shifts the focus to the sender's requirements, making it more self-centric.

Sentence 4: ""I would love to get your perspective and show you an example as well."" - Again, the emphasis is on what the sender wants (""I would love to""), although there is an attempt to involve the employee by seeking their perspective.

Sentence 5: ""Our goal is to continue to make you better at what you do and to deliver an excellent customer experience."" - This sentence is more other-centric, as it focuses on the employee's growth and the customer experience. However, the use of ""our goal"" still implies the sender's involvement.

Sentence 6: ""Looking forward to tackling this together and to your dedication to being great at what you do."" - While this sentence mentions working together, the focus is still on the sender's expectations (""looking forward to"") and the employee's dedication to meeting those expectations.

<analysis>
The email is primarily self-centric because the language used throughout the feedback emphasizes the sender's wants, needs, and expectations. Phrases like ""I would like,"" ""we need to,"" ""I would love to,"" and ""looking forward to"" place the focus on the sender rather than the employee receiving the feedback. Although there are instances of praise for the employee's contributions and mentions of working together, the overall tone and flow of the email suggest that the sender's priorities and goals take precedence. The feedback is framed in terms of what the sender requires from the employee, rather than centering the employee's growth and development. While the sender does express interest in the employee's perspective and dedication to improvement, the language used still implies that these are in service of meeting the sender's expectations.

I would like you to try and shorten the report and attempt to only include technical information but keep up the suggestions on improvements as a separate segment in the report. That way, we would be able to provide more timely reports catering to the wide audience in mind. You are a great engineer and i believe that development in business writing is a critical skillset that would help further your career.As you have mentioned, sometimes the sheer amount of information to collate is overwhelming. for this week, i would like you to start off early with penning down all the technical information and run them through Terry.

The purpose of the reports are of a technical nature, therefore you should focus on that aspect.  These reports are submitted to perspective customers and the CEO are should just stick to the technical aspects of the Beta project, and should be limited on opinions.

Sentence 1: ""Jonathan, First I want to thank you for your help with the Beta project."" - This sentence starts off positively by thanking Jonathan for his help, but the use of ""I"" and ""you"" sets up a self-centric tone.

Sentence 2: ""However, it has been brought to my attention that perhaps ABC-5 didn't do enough to prepare you for the extra work and I would like to discuss some issues."" - The use of ""I"" and the phrase ""it has been brought to my attention"" suggests that the feedback is coming from the perspective of the writer, rather than focusing on Jonathan's needs or the team's perspective.

Sentence 4: ""Your insights are very valuable and much appreciated but as the old line goes 'please give me just the facts'."" - While this sentence acknowledges Jonathan's insights, the use of ""me"" and the directive to provide ""just the facts"" emphasizes the writer's preferences and needs over Jonathan's contributions.

Sentence 5: ""Given the critical nature of the information you are providing I can't stress the importance of concise yet detail factual reports."" - The use of ""I"" and the strong emphasis on what the writer needs (concise and detailed reports) further contributes to the self-centric tone.

Sentence 6: ""I would like to review your reports as a training exercise to help you better meet the team requirements."" - Although this sentence mentions helping Jonathan meet team requirements, the focus is on what the writer wants to do (""I would like to review your reports"") and how it will help Jonathan meet the writer's expectations.

Sentence 7: ""Given that there are some major reports coming up in the immediate future, I would like you to review some training options and then present a report for review."" - Again, the emphasis is on what the writer wants Jonathan to do, rather than collaborating with Jonathan to identify areas for improvement or growth.

Sentence 8: ""Again your insights are appreciated but we need to make sure we are presenting the end-use with only the information they need to make a sound business decision."" - While this sentence acknowledges Jonathan's insights, the use of ""we"" and the emphasis on presenting information to the end-user reflects the writer's priorities and needs.

Sentence 9: ""I also understand you would like to grow into a leadership position so I would like to discuss how successfully implementing these changes would be beneficial in demonstrating an ability to grow and take on new challenges."" - This final sentence, while mentioning Jonathan's desire for growth, still centers around what the writer wants to discuss and how the writer believes Jonathan can demonstrate growth, rather than focusing on Jonathan's goals and collaborating on a development plan.

This email is an example of self-centric feedback because it primarily focuses on the writer's perspectives, needs, and expectations, rather than centering on the employee's development and growth. Throughout the email, the writer uses ""I"" statements and directives that emphasize their own preferences and requirements, such as ""I would like to review your reports"" and ""I can't stress the importance of concise yet detail factual reports."" While the writer acknowledges the employee's insights and desire for growth, the overall tone and language used in the feedback consistently prioritize the writer's viewpoint over the employee's needs and contributions. The feedback flows in a way that highlights the writer's concerns and expectations, rather than fostering a collaborative dialogue to support the employee's development. To shift towards a more other-centric approach, the writer could focus on the employee's strengths, actively seek their input, and work together to create a plan that aligns with the employee's goals and the team's objectives.

Great work on the Beta project your work is very much appreciated and valued.I have been getting updates from Terry and we have identified a few things that may be able to help with your continued development.What i would like you to do is start writing your reports containing only facts and if the project requires additional opinions we can discuss them as required.

141,"Good morning Jonathan, I hope you are well.  I would like to circle back with you regarding the reports that are being sent in. Unfortunately, we are not able to speak live but here are some key points to the way our reports need to be constructed as per the company’s standards. It is critical we keep to the main points for reporting to management. For example, if we add too much of our opinion it may mislead the direction or feedback given. Please ensure your reports are in the format we reviewed; bullet pointed with just the facts.You can always discuss your opinions after with Terry. Secondarily, I would recommend you scheduling a weekly conference call with Terry to work on the way we organize and construct the reports. This will further support upper managements review and understanding of data shared. Will you be able to meet these requirements?  I know you have high aspiration and professional goals to grow and look forward to supporting you getting there. These are some ofthe first steps to ensuring your future success within ABC-5. I will be checking in with Terry monthly to ensure we see improvement. Please let me know if you have questions, concerns or if this direction is not clear. Kind regards, William",0,test,empathy,
15,"Hello Jonathan, I will speak with Terry regarding the reports and make sure he knows what details to include. I am glad that he is finding the Beta project and all its applications to be so interesting and exciting. I will let him know we appreciate the effort he puts in but sometimes it is a little too much when we just need supporting facts for the report. If you are okay with it, I will show him some of your recent reports to coach on how they should be written so he has a better idea of what to include so there is not rework to be had. I would suggest working on the report together so you can discuss the amazing ways that the Beta project can be used so he isn't as inclined to include that in the report. We will discuss his goal of getting promoted to lead engineer and what steps he can take to ensure he gets where he wants. I would like to hear his thoughts on how the Beta project can be utilized across more areas and possibly how to incorporate them. Since he is so enthusiastic about the new technology we may be able to bring him on to work on new applications instead of just the reports. I will let you know how it goes.

I have spoken with some members of the team regarding the reports coming in, and the feedback received is that there is a lot of valuable facts being reported in addition to some application and thoughts you have. Going forward I think it would be best to keep the reports short and concise for quick reference by upper management, and then we can discuss the findings and thoughts on the facts once I am back in the office and at team meetings. If you could please include me in on the next report being sent out I am excited to see the facts that you are finding.

26,"Hi Jonathan, I hear you are doing a great job on the Beta project. Thank you for your contribution. While the technical findings of your report are very insightful and accurate there are some concerns about the length of the report and the manner in which they are structured. As these reports are very important to the organization we need to ensure they are precise, concise and to the point. I have 2 feedback pointers for you which can help you submit a better and a more meaningful report to the team While we value your insights on the technical points within the report, I would request you to segregate the technical findings and your insights into 2 different reports. This would help the team to easily identify the factual points and refer to your commentary for a detailed analysisI would also want you to structure your report in a better manner. Think and structure your thoughts before you start writing. Keep it short and simple and do not over complicate the report. Avoid jargons and pretentious words and be clear and direct. Finally you can get your report reviewed by a peer or your mentor before you submit the report. Lastly, I want you to be more committed and empowered to your deliverables. I do see a lot of potential in you and let us begin with setting career goals and a path to achieve the same. We can have a career discussion sometime this week and let us work on an improvement plan.",0,test,empathy,

As you know, this project is both crucial and time-sensitive (which is the same case as many other projects). I've had a chance to review some of your reports. It's obvious you're super passionate and engaged n the work, and have a hunger to share not only the facts, but also your POV. While this is great, when we're sending out reports to leadership, we have to make sure we're being mindful of their busy schedules/competing priorities. I think we have a chance to help streamline your comms so they're super easy to digest and don't require many rounds of revision before going out the door. I've included a couple best-in-class examples of reports, for you to review. I'd like you to familiarize yourself with this format, taking note of the content included - and not included. You'll note that they just have the facts, not commentary. A hunger to showcase your curiosity and insights is great, but these comms must only include facts. There are other forums we can create to ensure your passion isn't being kept at bay, but we need the reports to be really tight. As a next steps, please shoot me a copy of your next report, using this template. From there, I'll provide some quick notes to help ensure we're modeling the template and setting up the comms in a tighter way for leadership.

I've been in touch with Terry, I'm so glad to hear how much you are enjoying the Beta Project, I even hear you are hoping that this experience will further your ambitions toward a Lead Engineer position! However, I understand there has been some issues with your reports that Terry has brought up with you, and I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss them.1) Opinion vs. FactsYour reports contain a lot of insights about what the data means, and at times finding the specific hard facts can be difficult.2) Level of DetailYou include every bit of data that you can into your reports, which can make it difficult to take away the larger picture.I want to encourage you to take these things away for the following reasons:1) your reports are reviewed by everyone in upper management, including the CEO! The opinions you have are great, but when evaluating documents the CEO just needs to highest level, most important items. The nitty-gritty would fall to another department2) as you have a desire to move up and be a Lead Engineer, these kinds of reports will be more and more common. Keeping your thoughts organized and well documented is going to become a very important skill to have.For your next report I would like you to prepare a cover sheet that goes with the report. This cover sheet should be a single page highlighting only the key facts of the report. Your own opinions and analysis can be included, but let those who are interested read it on their own time, the high level facts are key for the meeting they will be presented in. I would also encourage you to make sure the rest of the report has clearly defined headings and topics, so it is easy to find information related to each item. I",1,train,empathy,"<reasoning>

118,"Good Afternoon Jonathan, I hope you are well and the travelling is not too exhausting. I wanted to touch base with you to see how you are enjoying working with the Beta project team? I have been advised that you are a great contributor and are identifying some great improvements, so well done. I understand you are completing a lot of reports and imagine this is quite time consuming which added to your traveling must be quite overwhelming. I have reviewed some of your reports and whilst they provide all the technical information that is required, they are quite lengthy and i think it would be beneficial for you to have some training on report structures. This would mean you could spend less time on the reports by providing only the main facts needed and perhaps take on more responsibility.  When the reports are reviewed by higher management they need to be able to clearly and quickly identify any issues. Attending some training would also be great to add to your career profile for the future. In the meantime perhaps you could review your reports before submitting to ensure they are clear and consise with only the technical information needed,Let me know your thoughts. Many thanks again and well done for all your hard work. Kind regards William",0,train,empathy,"<reasoning>
Sentence 1: The opening sentence is polite and shows concern for the employee's well-being, but it does not directly contribute to the self-centric nature of the email.

Sentence 2: The manager acknowledges the employee's good work and contributions, which is positive feedback. However, the phrase ""I have been advised"" suggests that the manager is relying on others' opinions rather than directly observing the employee's performance.

Sentence 3: The manager acknowledges the employee's workload and the time-consuming nature of the reports. This shows some understanding of the employee's situation, but the focus is still on the manager's perspective.

Sentence 4: The manager critiques the employee's reports, stating that they are lengthy and need improvement. While this feedback is necessary, the way it is phrased focuses on the manager's opinion and needs rather than offering constructive suggestions for the employee's growth.

Sentence 5: The manager suggests training to improve report writing skills, but the reasoning is centered around the benefits for the manager and higher management, such as spending less time reviewing reports. The employee's career development is mentioned briefly, but it seems like an afterthought.

Sentence 6: The manager emphasizes the importance of clear and concise reports for higher management, again focusing on the needs of the organization rather than the employee's development.

Sentence 7: The manager reiterates the suggestion for training, framing it as an opportunity for the employee's career profile. However, this comes after the emphasis on the manager's and organization's needs, making it seem less genuine.

Sentence 8: The manager instructs the employee to review their reports before submitting them, focusing on the technical information needed. This directive is given without offering guidance or support on how to achieve the desired outcome.

Sentence 9: The manager asks for the employee's thoughts, but only after providing criticism and instructions. This gives the impression that the manager is not truly open to a dialogue.

Sentence 10: The manager concludes with appreciation for the employee's hard work, but the praise feels somewhat insincere given the critical nature of the feedback.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
The email is self-centric because the manager's feedback primarily focuses on their own needs and the organization's requirements, rather than prioritizing the employee's growth and development. The manager's language emphasizes the importance of clear and concise reports for higher management, suggesting that the employee's efforts should be directed towards meeting the manager's expectations. While the manager does acknowledge the employee's hard work and offers suggestions for improvement, these points are overshadowed by the self-centric tone of the email.

The feedback is structured in a way that highlights the manager's concerns and opinions, with less emphasis on the employee's perspective. The manager's suggestion for training is framed as a solution to reduce the time spent reviewing reports, rather than as an opportunity for the employee's professional growth. The overall tone of the email is critical and directive, with the manager providing instructions on how the employee should improve their work without offering much guidance or support. These elements collectively contribute to the self-centric nature of the feedback, as the manager's priorities and needs take precedence over the employee's development and well-being.

66,"Hello Jonathan, First at all I hope you are having a safe trip. The main objective of this mail is to know your opinion about some feedback that I have received from one of your colleagues about your reports of the Beta Project.The main problem is that the words and way to express yourself in the reports are not at a management level, and don't get it wrong, the technical data is in there and helps to the team but also there is too much ""non-important"" information that creates confusion into the reports.The idea is to have a all the good technical data into the reports and go direct to the point and avoid as much as possible write ""trivial"" things that are not adding value. Let's do something, next time you create a report, please send it to me and so I can review it and then I can give you some feed back about this trying to polish your writing, what do you think? Please let me know your comments.Don't feel this mail as an attack but as a way to improve and reach in a near future your desired promotion. Best regards, William",0,test,empathy,

I got a day here and decided on connect with you on the Beta project.I heard good things about the information you have been providing on the project and how helpful it has been. Looks like you are enjoying the work and are enthusiastic about it. What is equally important is to ensure that others are equally excited about your work too. I have received feedback that your reports are turning too verbose and you need improvement on your report writing skills.Jonathan.. All your hard work will go underappreciated if you are not able to put it to an efficient output that others can quickly understand and appreciate.Here are some suggestions for you:Review and edit your final product: You may want to put everything you think is important in your first draft. But once you're done, do multiple reviews and question yourself on each segment, if it is really important, can this be concise, is this repetitive. With each review, your reports will definitely improve.Stick to technical facts: While I understand the urge to provide explanations and inferences so you can provide a detailed picture. You can structure it differently. Create a main concise section with only the important points, which should be the final report. You can add additional reference section with the details for anyone who needs more information.  This will allow people who do not have the time to read the detailed reports to also get the gist.Enroll for Business Writing training program:  Get in touch with HR to help you find a suitable program. Improving these skills will help  you in long term.You are a hard working ambitious guy, and with your aspiration to be a lead engineer, it is important that you are deliverable are high quality and appreciated by team and customers.Do send a copy of your current report and the one you will create after incorporating these suggestions. This will help you put a timeline and get an outside perspective. I will review and give me feedback for further development, once I am back Good Luck!",0,test,empathy,
41,"Jonathan, It has come to my attention that there have been issues with the way in which you are reporting the findings amongst the team. I am aware that business writing is not something you have been formally trained on, so I have booked time for you to take a seminar on it to be completed before your next report is due. I understand that you have a passion for this work, however, we need the report to be technically sound and to keep our own personal opinions out of the equation, by focusing on the facts. I learned to utilize the inverted pyramid style when writing, by placing all the important topics at the top and then further along going into detail. I know that once you complete this course, your work will become concise and it will make you an even better contributor to the team. When you land, please set up a time so we can discuss further.

142,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you for all your efforts in helping collect information for the company! Your data are invaluable to our successes. I recently reviewed one of your technical reports and have a few thoughts on it. In order for the readers of your reports to gather all the relevant information quickly and efficiently, your reports need to be more concise. Since everyone, including yourself, is very busy, the reports only should contain the relevant technical information. You may provide some additional commentary if asked by the reader. This will streamline our processes and ensure a smooth transfer of data. I would like for you to review some reports of Alex to see examples of how they should be completed. I have informed Alex of this and he should be setting up a meeting to go over any questions you may have. We can also arrange for you to attend an outside writing course at a local university if that interests you. I know you have been putting in a lot of effort and are enthusiastic about all the information you gather to support our work. This is greatly appreciated. If your reports become more concise & technically proficient, this will only help your career move in a positive direction.

Impressive!!I do however need you help with the way we're collecting the data, as you know these reports are being shared with the CEO and are also customer facing. So we must ensure that when these reports are submitted they should only include the facts and if you have some personal views, you can still share them but not in these reports. You will have to share your opinions separately, as we do value your input, but cannot include them in the reports.We also need to work on your layout when putting these reports together to ensure that they are easy to read and the reader gets all the information you are providing. I understand this isnt human nature to a lot of people and its just something we need to support you with, so going forward you need to have either myself (if I'm around) or someone else review them to ensure the reports reflects the best possible outcome for you and the business. I'm keen to see you succeed and this will be valuable development for you as an individual, especially one day if you were interested in stepping up to a lead engineer position once one became available, this is the sort of development and support you could pass on to junior engineers.Let me know if this makes sense and if you have any concerns.

It is important that you keep in mind who will be reading these reports and what this audience is looking to get out of them.  Keeping them brief and to the point would reflect well on your ability to identify the pertinent facts in a timely manner, a key quality that the company looks for in their Lead Engineers.Any commentary you may have should be kept as concise and brief, and placed at the very end of the  report so it will not be confused with the facts.Keeping your reports more concise and brief will reflect well on your abilities.

Your contribution in collecting technical information has been very useful, however there are few concerns / improvement areas that are critical for Terry and is also expected in your support.

I am writing to you regarding the Beta project - first of all, thank you for your commitment and hard work on this project, I am happy to see you motivated and excited about this challenging project. I noticed that your reports come with many details and that you also include personal considerations in it. Some feedback from my side, which I think it's important also considering your aspiration to move up to Lead Engineer in the future.Consider *who* you are writing these reports to - the end recipient is the customer or our CEO, and he/she has usually limited amount of time to scroll through and gather as much information as possible, from an objective point of view. If you want to be a Lead Engineer in the future and lead a team, you will be in the very same situationBe concise, precise, and put in only hard-facts statement. Organize it in a clear structure, with bold titles and few, relevant bullet points  with information relevant from a managerial standpoint. Keep in mind the end-recepient of the reports. By doing this, you will",0,dev,empathy,

I would like to understand from you if there are any areas you feel you need support on. I would have liked a face to face conversation on this, however because you are travelling and we are unable to speak, I am drafting this note. After some of the feedback I have received, I think it will be good if you review your report writing skills. Look at this very objectively, as a person who may finally be reading this report, what kind of concise information will help the reader understand and grasp the information quickly and make decisions on the same. You must understand the report you make are critical to the business and can make a significant impact . You are creating an image of yourself  and your team in front of the top management with these reports. It will be good to take some feedback from team regarding how to improve the overall quality , as well look at some of the well drafted reports which have been appreciated in the past.

162,"Hi Jonathan, hope you are enjoying your time and work on the Gamm project? I received some positive feedback from your contributions to the project, so I am glad that your engagement has a positive effect! In particular, you seem to accumalte a lot of useful information of the project, which is very good. On the other hand, I am also received feedback from people working with the reports, that it is hard for them to actually process all the information contained within. This isn't to say the information you gathered is useless, it just needs to be presented in a more structured and concise form. I know you being a technician, this isn't always easy, but it really is something you need to work on to make your work even more effective. As a hint, try to take on the perspective of the people reading the reports: can they follow your thoughts, do they have quick access to the information they need? We might also think about setting up a training for you helping you on this line of work.I know that your goal is to become a technical lead and I definitely see you on the way there with the experiences you make on the Beta project. Part of that job is to also present information in the way described above, so the people you lead can act efficiently. By working on this, you will definitely also learn to be better lead in your future. Please let me know your thoughts on this and continue to have a good and effective time on the Beta project!

It is clear that you are excited about this opportunity to be a part of this team and that is great! I do want to provide you some feedback on your work to date to make sure you are on track and working to your full potential to support the group. It is important to remember that this is a fact finding mission. It is important to keep in mind the audience that will inevitably end up reading these reports- high level executives with limited time. It is important to be clear, concise and factual with these reports, which will allow less editing by the rest of the team before final submital. Although I appreciate your passion for the project, it is critical to separate fact from opinion to be successful in this role. Perhaps you could submit your next report directly to me first for review prior to submittal to the rest of the team so I can help ensure you are on track. Also, when you have some free time, give me a call and tell me all the exciting things you are learning with this new project and we can discuss how you can use your performance on this team to leverage this experience for future projects. I'm looking forward to reading your new approach on your next report! Thanks in advance and I look forward to hearing from you! William",0,dev,empathy,
115,"Hi Jonathan, Thanks for your help with the Beta project. Your effort in collecting technical data and enthusiasm for the project are well noted and appreciated by the team. I have collected some feedback on your technical reports and identified a few areas for improvement that will help you and the team be more successful and efficient.  While your opinions on the technical details and requirements are appreciated, in the reports we need to focus on the technical requirements that have data to support them. There are two issues with your reporting that need to be resolved immediately or someone else will take over your role on project Beta.1) The reports are rolled up to higher level executives who have limited time and need to see only the technical facts with supporting data.  Please convey your opinions and commentary on the data verbally, in person, not directly in your reports.2) Your technical background is highly regarded but your reports are difficult for higher level executives to quickly digest.  Please ask Terry for an example of one of your previous reports that he has edited and compare it to your original version.  I think you will see the differences and be able to implement the changes yourself in the future.Please let me know that you understand these issues and let me know if you have any questions. Making these improvements to your reports will be critical to your personal and career development at ABC-5. Best regards, William",0,dev,empathy,

However i would just like to discuss a few areas on concern with you for this particular project. Terry has informed me that although you have identified some great improvements your reports are unfortunately too long with too much of commentary and the team cant really separate fact from your opinion. He says he did mention this to you before but it was not taken seriously. I see the passion in your work we just need to focus and streamline it a bit more so that you can deliver a report that is correct and eveyone can understand.I think first things first is to get you enrolled into a training program for businee/report writing to help you get the technical knowledge. i also would like to assign you a mentor that has great experience with report writing that can help you when you need it. We can also have regular check-ins to see how the progress is being made.I know with your travels it might be easeir to do the training online so maybe in the meantime start doing some research on this.

Impressive!!I do however need you help with the way we're collecting the data, as you know these reports are being shared with the CEO and are also customer facing. So we must ensure that when these reports are submitted they should only include the facts and if you have some personal views, you can still share them but not in these reports. You will have to share your opinions separately, as we do value your input, but cannot include them in the reports. We also need to work on your layout when putting these reports together to ensure that they are easy to read and the reader gets all the information you are providing. I understand this isnt human nature to a lot of people and its just something we need to support you with, so going forward you need to have either myself (if I'm around) or someone else review them to ensure the reports reflects the best possible outcome for you and the business. I'm keen to see you succeed and this will be valuable development for you as an individual, especially one day if you were interested in stepping up to a lead engineer position once one became available, this is the sort of development and support you could pass on to junior engineers.Let me know if this makes sense and if you have any concerns.

Im looking forward to your report but I did want to bring up a couple things that may help you.  I dont know if we covered this before assigning you this project but the group your reports go to are responsible for presenting them to the CEO who is looking for the facts about your findings in order to make critical decisions.  I would like you to keep this in mind when you write your next report so you can keep it fact based in the body of the report and add your opinion or solutions as an addendum as a separate piece at the end.  They are also very busy and sometimes may need to hand your report directly to the CEO without going through it beforehand.  With this in mind please write it as a fact based business report that may end up on the CEOs desk. This is a great opportunity fo you to have access to upper management and allow you to pursue your career growth within the company if done correctly. Please email me when you receive this with questions and the changes you will make to your future reports.  We can talk about specific examples if needed.

I have received very good feedback about your contributions to the Beta project. Congratulations!Jonathan, along with all the good things I heard about you, there is a concern that has come up. This is regarding the reports that you have been submitting. Your reports seem to have too many details and are poorly organized. I understand that you try to share your insights on the Beta project through these reports. However, it would really bring out your best work if you keep your reports restricted to only the technical information and more concise. Would you like some help to hone your business writing skills? If yes, please reach out to HR for access to business writing courses or trainings. Do set up some time with Terry for him to take you through some reports he has drafted. I would also recommend you to read some of your reports that Terry has edited before sending to our prospective customers or ABC-5's CEO. I'm sure you understand that as important as it is to do a good job, it is also important to be able to draft reports that help others get to the most important facts quickly and in the best way possible.  Here is another idea. Would you consider having verbal discussions or virtual meetings with the team to share the information that you consider really valuable to the team? I am sure the team would love to learn from the unique insights and perspectives that you have on the Beta project. Let me know what you think.

Specifically, the clarity, conciseness and technicality of the report.

Sometimes, opinions could be wrong either due to our biasness or our lack of knowledge, hence facts based report would make the report more credible.2) Length: As this report is for our customer or CEO, they would appreciate if the report is high level, containing only information that they have to know to make a decision. Furthermore, they are extremely busy and thus would prefer the report to be straight to the point.Going forward, I hope you could take note of them and give them a deeper thought.

85,"Jonathan, I am very excited about your enthusiasm in working on this Beta project. However, I do want to address some areas of concern in regards to your reports for the project. There has been an ask that you are a bit more concise with only including the facts of your findings and less suggestions. We need to make sure that the other team members can get the information they need to assess the situation and perform their portion of the project. In order to accomplish this task, I have a training class that I would like for you to attend on report writing so that you will have the tools you need in order to succeed.I am really excited to hear about all of your suggestions from what you are learning and would like to set a time to meet with you so that I can hear about all of these suggestions that you may have and we can get them shared in a different platform. Again, thanks for all you are doing to make this project a success!",0,test,empathy,
154,"Hi Jonathan, I just heard from Terry. He had some good things to say about your contributions and commitment to the project. He also shared some concerns he had about the written reports you had submitted to him. I believe that most of these concerns are due to the fact that you have not been done a lot of business writing before. Since the reports are critical and time-bound, it is imperative that they are concise and contain minimal commentary. There is an upcoming training on business writing skills, why don't you enroll for the same. It would help you improve your soft skills and also help you grow in the    organization. Let me know if you have any concerns. Warm regards, William",0,test,empathy,
19,"Jonathan, I first want to say that I am thrilled with your level of engagement and excitement on the Beta project. Terry mentioned that he spoke with you about your reports.  I hope to provide some context that Terry may have missed. It is important for our team to understand that Terry's engineering team is very time constrained. For that reason, there are two important things we can do in our reports:Take them straight to the key points. Ensure that the reports are polished and ready to hand off to prospective customers.This is a great opportunity for you to develop and demonstrate an elevated level of understanding of key business drivers, which is especially important if you'd like to be promoted to Lead Engineer. Please prioritize finishing your next report 2 days before it is due to engineering so that we have time to review together beforehand. I am happy to provide any extra development opportunities that will improve both the reporting, and set you up for next steps in your career. Sincerely, William",0,test,empathy,
102,"Hi Jonathan. Thank you for taking time out to meet with me. I want to start off by saying Thank you for assisting with the Beta project. You are a great contributor and very personable. You are innovative in a way that you identify improvements we didn't know we needed! Jonathan, with strengths, there also comes opportunitesto improve. Jonathan, I need for you to work on the structure and presentation of your reports.I appreciate all of your ideas and insights, but in your reports, there's often personal opinions mixed in with technical information, which essentially causes added work of editing. What I need from you is to become more concise. Also, how you structure your report is just as important as the content. I need for you to make sure that it is organized and clear for our editors to read. Some ways you can improve include rereading the reports aloud before sending them in or asking your peers for advice until you feel 100% confident. You expressed your concerns with collecting so much information. I would love to help you condense all of your learnings and structure your reports to where all of your topics are clearly outlined. I will give you an example of the type of format that I am looking for, that way you will be able to clearly see the expectations. Jonathan, I need your commitment of improvement by your nextreport. If you need any help before submitting, be sure to collaborate with your peers, as I will be on a special assignment after today. I know you are interested in growing with the company, so I hope you channel this feedback and capitalize this opportunity to improve.  I am happy that we got a chance to sit down. Is there anything that I can assist with to help you succeed? Your love for learning and developingwill continue to help you succeed with the Beta project. ",0,test,empathy,
160,"Hi Jonathan, I wanted to reach out to you regarding some feedback I received thus far on the Beta project.  First of all, your team really values your insights on the production and enjoys your engagement in the process. While the reports to date have been thorough the report needs more organization so that the team can quickly ascertain the facts that needs as they include this information to upper management.  One particular area of concern is that main points or facts are often hard to decipher amongst your own commentary or opinions.  Also some of the wording you are choosing is not as professional as other examples we have seen. To assist you with this process, I want to provide the attached template that we have used in previous reports. In reviewing this reporting, I hope that you can follow the structure going forward and see how your insights can still be included by at the end of the document in a footnote or appendix. To assist with the adding a more organized and professional tone to your writing, I also want to send you to an online training course that should be able to help you streamline your thought process and provide clearer and more concise reporting. If time allows, going forward I would suggest that you send your reports to your counterpoints to provide commentary prior to final submission. I think these tools will help you to excel in this role and provide more value to your team.  I encourage you to seek their feedback directly as you look to improve and this is critically important to your success within the team. I am confident that this experience will be invaluable in your future roles with the company and again we appreciate your efforts on our behalf.",0,dev,empathy,
55,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are well?It has been brought to my attention that we are having issues with the technical report writing on the Beta Project, which I am hoping you can help correct and resolve? There are two main issues as shown below: Additional Commentary which are opinion based and not necessarily just focused on the facts. This makes the reports very difficult to digest and summarize.Lack of organization which requires additional re-work before being passed onto the CEO or prospective customer. In order to improve this, I will ask Terry to provide you with additional feedback which I am requesting you take on board for the future report writing. There are several reports coming up and if we make these changes now, it will help the team meeting the deadlines moving forward.If you feel like you need additional training on report writing please let me know? Please take this as positive feedback and continue with your enthusiasm on the Beta Project. Kind Regards William",0,dev,empathy,

I understand that you have been putting in a lot of effort in traveling and gathering very good technical information. I'm glad that you are excited about this project and want to share all the information that you have collected. Considering that this project has very technical requirements, and the persons receiving the reports need it in time to decide on the follow up actions, we need clear and concise reports. In view of this, I would appreciate if your trim your reports and focus on the technical aspects of your findings. I know this is a relatively new experience for you, and as such, we could organize a quick technical writing training or you when you are back in the office. Let me know how I can help, if anything is not clear. Regards, William",0,test,empathy,
5,"Dear Jonathan, Came to know about the good work you are doing on the Beta project. It seems great to work with dedicated and passionate colleagues like you. The purpose of this communicate is mainly to apprise you on some improvement areas which if you will work on will end up saving lot of time for the colleagues working with you on the project. The following two areas are creating some rework for the team members and considering the time pressure it would be appreciated if you could work on them:1: Focus on facts and creating to the point reports: This would ensure that the team will not end up spending time on separating the facts from your personal opinions. 2: Work on your business writing skills: While your detailing is commendable but please ensure that the reports are as per the organisational guidelines and not verbose. This would also end up in saving lot of time of the colleagues working on the project. I am sure that you will work on the above and come back to me with the improvement plan. If you want I can suggest some good training programs on Business Writing to you. Do let me know. Thanks and Best Regards",0,test,empathy,
93,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing good! Understand that you are quite happy with the Beta Project and gaining a lot of experience out of it. This is really an exciting opportunity for you.Keeping in mind the opportunity comes a bit of responsibility also. Considering the reports that you are sending, it's really good to know that you are giving enough insights in form of commentary along with the technical information. You have done a really good job as far as technical information is concerned, on the other hand one should have an understanding about what exactly the reader of the report wants. In this case they would only want to see the technical information rather than along with your perspectives on the report. Suggest you to concentrate on the technical findings only as this will result in less time spend for the end user to search for the facts and thus will meet the deadlines which I believe has been a struggle in the recent past. I suggest you to just have a quick 10 mins call with me just before submitting the report so that we are on the same page and figure out if the facts are clearly visible.Since you are gaining on experience, I would suggest you to undergo trainings on business writing. By doing so you will understand how to convey your message in a short and crisp way. This will not only save time for yourself and your counter part but will also help you to communicate exactly what you want to.I will suggest your name for the upcoming training and you can participate to change for the better.This is in line with the feedback I received as they are quite happy with the technical facts still there are some areas of improvement.

Your reporting have been beneficial but we need to streamline your content to make provide all needed technical details with less commentary. The time it takes to update your reports is taking away from other critical matters. Going forward I want you to review your report after Terry has made updates to understanding what we are looking to receive from you and make sure your current reporting content is similar.

Your insights have been very helpful with regard to the necessary improvements.  However, I have received a few pieces of feedback on your work that I would like to share to benefit your efforts.The team here is having challenges with deciphering your technical information and facts from your own personal perspectives on the findings.  While your personal perspective is important, in order to showcase your work efficiently for senior management and our customers, I will need you to work on editing your personal commentary and stating your key message and findings at the top of your reports.I have also received feedback that your reports are unorganized.  It is important to make sure you heavily edit your work before sending it back, so the team is well aware of the most crucial information to share with senior management and our customers.  It is unfortunately taking the team here too much time to go through your reports which is causing them to be late.  Please work on reviewing your reports and making sure the most important information is highlighted in a way that someone could easily review it within a couple of minutes.I hope this information has been helpful.  Please let me know when I am back in the office if I can help you in any way to further your learnings on this topic.

How you know our focus and in our DNA we have continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. I consider it essential that you have a meeting with Terry so that he can explain what he needs and so it may be that what you send is very good but for him it is not functional.

Focus on customer needs3. Document what was agreed at the meeting and share it with CC to Terry.With these simple steps I am 100% sure that your work will be even more appreciated, in addition to that it will give me tools to help you to continue developing and well one step close to achieve the goal you have of being Lead engineer.Appreciate your actions and efforts.

I'd recommend paying attention to final content and clarity and brevity of the article.Remember - often times these are getting passed tot he CEO for reading!

Sentence 1: ""Hi Jonathan, I wanted to have a discussion with you but since you are travelling i am sharing in this mail"" - This sentence is focused on the writer's own desires and convenience, rather than considering the recipient's availability or preferences.

Sentence 2: ""This is related to Beta project and reports coming from there."" - Neutral statement providing context.

Sentence 3: ""While we are all excited by the passion and enthusiasm you are bringing i wanted to share some early feedback with you."" - The writer acknowledges the recipient's positive qualities but quickly shifts the focus to their own intention to provide feedback, making it more about their own agenda.

Sentence 4: ""1.Please try to be concise in reports and mention facts that teams can refer .

Thank you so much for your time today and I look forward to working with you. ",0,train,empathy,"Here is my analysis of the feedback email:

<reasoning>
Sentence 1: Hi Jonathan, I am glad to hear that you are enjoying your job, traveling and learning more about the Beta ray technology. - This opening sentence is focused on Jonathan and his experience, which is other-centric. However, the rest of the email is much more focused on the manager's perspective.

Sentence 2: I wanted to share some feedback with you that I received. - Here the manager centers themselves by saying they received feedback and want to share it. It's about the manager's actions.

Sentence 3: I want to help you be able to advance in your career and I feel that this feedback will be helpful. - While couched in terms of helping Jonathan's career, this statement is really about what the manager wants and feels, making it self-centric. 

Sentence 4: I am excited that you are will to share your perspectives on the findings, however if you could focus on the data portion first, and highlight the main points, that would be really beneficial to your audience. - The manager expresses their preferences for how Jonathan should write his reports. It's centered on what the manager thinks is best.

Sentence 5: By being more concise it will allow the potential customers and then CEO to focus on the facts of the report, which will allow them to make a decision for themselves. - The manager asserts their view of what customers and the CEO need. While mentioning others, it still comes from the manager's perspective.

Sentence 6: I understand that this is probably a newer to writing the reports, and I don't think that anyone has shown you an example of how the reports are usually written, so I have sent you some examples for you to review. - The manager assumes what Jonathan's experience is and imposes their solution of sending examples, without asking what would be helpful to Jonathan. It's about the manager's assessment and actions.

Sentence 7: I think that you are doing a good job learning and with this little tweak in the report writing you will be able to advance in your career. - While praising Jonathan, the manager centers their own thoughts on Jonathan's performance and career prospects. The phrasing of ""little tweak"" also minimizes Jonathan's need to improve from the manager's view.

Sentence 8: In order to help you, if you don't mind, I would like to review the report before you submit it and then we can work together to ensure it will be a great report. - The manager imposes additional oversight on Jonathan's work based on their own preference. Asking ""if you don't mind"" doesn't negate the self-centric imposition, since it would be awkward for Jonathan to object.

Sentence 9: I understand that you really enjoy providing your perspectives on the technology and recommendations on how it can be used, so we will find a spot for that in the report as well, but perhaps in a different section. - The manager asserts their understanding of what Jonathan enjoys in report writing and decides unilaterally how those elements should be incorporated. It's focused on the manager's direction.

Sentence 10: Thank you so much for your time today and I look forward to working with you. - A generic closing line that doesn't change the overall self-centric tone.

The email has a friendly tone overall, but the content and phrasing are predominantly focused on the manager's own perspective, preferences, and decision-making. The feedback is directive, based on the manager's assessment, without seeking much input from Jonathan.
</reasoning>

<analysis>
This email is an example of self-centric feedback because the manager consistently centers their own perspective, preferences, and opinions throughout the message. While the feedback is ostensibly meant to help Jonathan improve his report writing and advance his career, the manager frames most points in terms of what they think, feel, and want.

The manager asserts their assessment of Jonathan's skills and experience, decides what would be beneficial for Jonathan's audience, and expresses their own excitement and understanding. The manager also imposes their preferred solutions, such as sending example reports and adding an extra review step, without asking Jonathan what would be helpful to him.

The focus of the email is on the manager's viewpoint and decisions, rather than collaborating with Jonathan or eliciting his input. The self-centric tone overshadows the positive intent to help Jonathan develop his skills. To be more other-centric, the manager could ask more questions, gather Jonathan's perspective, and frame the feedback in terms of Jonathan's goals and preferences.

However, it appears your approach should be refined because your current reporting is not meeting our needs.

Others on the team have spent significant time editing your reporting to our standards, and they cannot continue to do so. I suggest you review the prior reporting and adapt your style to meet the needs of our team, i.e. we need only well organized facts that can easily be understood by our audience (remember, you're writing to the audience's needs, not your own). You're welcome to include more commentary in an email to me and the team, because we do appreciate a lot of your insights, but we do not have room for it within the report. If you cannot commit to this change now, we will recommend removing you from the project. Thank you. William",0,dev,empathy,
108,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are well. I apologize for not being present this past month due to my commitment outside of our teams responsibilities. I have received some feedback from the team on your recent reports. We need to address them. I understand you receive lots of information and i appreciate this. However, our daily lives are filled with only so many hours. I have to request you to summarize these reports concisely so that your best ideas are highlighted to the team and they spend their time just reviewing these.  I will also ask HR to find you a training program to improve your writing skills. This will help with your development and help you with your personal goals. You are of great value to the team and we want you to improve. I hope you take this positively. We will review your reports when I get back in 2 weeks. Best, William",0,test,empathy,
194,"Hello Jonathan, I hope you are travelling well.I am touching base regarding your contributions to the Beta Project. I know between our current priorities, connecting over the phone may be difficult so I just wanted to reach out, hear about your experience with the team and also attend to some feedback received regarding your reporting.The Beta team really appreciate your contributions and suggestions to make improvements, so great work there. The feedback regarding the level of detail in the reports is where the team would like to see some improvements. As you know, these reports are crucial more some senior leaders and customers to make key decisions. It's very important we stick to the facts when sharing these reports. Although additional context and insight may be helpful, sharing these details are probably best left for other forums and conversations. Would you like to send me the next report you work on, so we can have a look through it together and then share it with the Beta team? I'd love to get an understanding of your view on the reporting style, so please let me know when you have time for a call. Thanks, William",0,dev,empathy,
199,"Jonathan, I am reaching out to you today for a coaching opportunity with regards to your reporting. I have noticed that your reports are full of extra information. I understand that you are just trying to be more thorough and I appreciate that effort. The problem that we are running into is the time it takes us to weed through the opinions to get to the facts so we can present your findings. Sometimes less is more. Jonathan, we need to be able to trust that your reporting will change. I understand that you want to move up in our organization, and this will go a long way towards showing us that you can do what's best for the company. I would like to proof your next three reports before sending them to Terry, just to make sure we are on the same page. This means finishing those reports at least a day ahead of the deadline, so you need to prioritize your time. Do you foresee any issues with this plan? Thank you, William",0,test,empathy,
185,"Good Afternoon Jonathan, Terry has brought to my attention some concerns with the reports that he's received from you recently. He has pointed out two areas that require improvement soon as they are causing additional work when finalizing reports. First, he believes that there is too much commentary in your reports. for the sake of deadlines, only include the most pertinent information your reports. His other concern was that your reports are not to the level they should be. They are unorganized and need extra editing before they can be presented to the prospective clients often times making the reports late. I know that this can be a little discouraging since you've expressed interesting in moving up, but we can definitely work together to help you improve. I will have Terry, send me your previous emails so I can go over them and identify the areas where we can help you in improve. Additionally, I will assign you one to revise so you can get a better idea of what info we need in these reports.Please reach out to me if you have any concerns of your own. Best, William",0,test,empathy,
52,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you for some of your insights on the Beta project, I have recieved some good feedback!There are a few things that I think would help make your contributions more valued. Considering the time and  effort being put into this by you, and other stakeholders , these will go a long way in taking this to the next level. Considering your future aspirations in this role, I want your report to be the final presentation that is shared with customers, instead of a draft that others need to edit or modify - this will give you the right visibilty with senior leadership, and build your reputation as a trusted senior advisorCan you set up a discussion with Terry, and ask him to share with you the final versions of your reports that are sent to clients - it will help you evaluate what needs to change.I understand some of these might even require training in business writing, so it would even help to participate in upcoming trainings on the subject - you can speak to HR about schedules and costs, I would be more than happy to fund this. Good luck !Regards William",0,test,empathy,
44,"Hey Jonathan, I hope all is well! I've been hearing great things about you as usual. However, there has been a few concerns regarding your reports on the Beta project. I understand you are very passionate about your findings however, using the ABC-5 report to voice your thoughts is not the right forum. The ABC-5 team requires concise reports to meet critical deadlines and would greatly appreciate if you could stick to the technical details and facts only. Nevertheless, your insight have identified many improvements for the business and I would still like your voice to be heard. I will setup a meeting with you once I am back to discuss other options of collecting your feedback. Keep up the good work! William.",0,test,empathy,
