95,"Hi Jonathan, I wanted to reach out to thank you for all of your work on the Beta project! It sounds like you are working well with the team and doing a great job of identifying some needed improvements! Today, I would like to discuss your reports. I've looked over the last few and identified a couple of areas of improvement, specifically around the extra commentary that was included and the accuracy/organization. The Beta project is extremely important and if it fails, many of us could lose our jobs. For that reason, I would like for you to collaborate with Terry when creating your reports so that we can ensure that they are in line with what is expected. I know that this is a new project for you and I'm sure you are excited, but also a little overwhelmed. Terry will help support you through this learning curve and you will be up to speed in no time. Can you give me your commitment that you will work through this with him? Thank you for your support, William"
198,"Good Morning Jonathan, I wanted to get with you on some feedback I've received on the reports you are submitting. Your enthusiasm and eagerness to be head engineer is appreciated. However when sending the reports out we need to make sure we have all the facts and that we are leaving personal feeling s and comments out of them. When there are meetings planned to go over reports and other business needs that s where everyone can give their own opinions.  If you could start cc me on all reports so I can get a feel of how things are going that would be great. Sometimes just the facts and information is what is needed when writing such reports. I think you have great enthusiasm and drive when giving your reports so lets do this moving forward just  keep them to just the facts and information that is needed in them and see where that takes you.Let me know if you need any assistance on this. William"
23,"Hi Jonathan, I learnt that you are working on Beta project and providing excellent information to Terry. Here are few points i would like you to take care: It has been observed that your report is having too much of information, i request you to please summarize it with the facts and relevant data. you can share your assumptions separately. because having too much of information in the report may loose interest. Generally Beta project team is concern only about the facts so our reports should contain only facts. I really appreciate you for your excellent findings and opinions, and i do understand you are new for business writing and dont have much experience in this area. So i you go through a formal training for business writting it will add up value to your reports. I have requested Terry to arrange a formal training as per your available schedule. please go thriugh that.I hope you do understand the concern here but still if you feel we can discuss further please let me know we can discuss. Regards, William"
81,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are doing well! I wanted to reach out to you to see how things are going out in the field and talk specifically about the Beta project. How do you think you are doing on this project? Are you encountering any obstacles to complete your reports on time? We have a standard of work for report writing and I've noticed that your reports are not following our required format. I understand that this is a new experience for you and I know that you are eager to do well. We need the formatting to be more concise and organized so that the prospective customers can easily use this tool to make their business decisions. I have some ideas that will help you grow and improve in this area. I know how motivated you are to do well. And I have seen from your history with the company that you are on track to advance your position in the company, but before that time comes, we need to have a solid foundation and understanding of our techniques. Can I have your promise to commit to my plan for improvement?First, I would like to pair you up with Terry. I want you to see how he prepares his reports . He is an excellent mentor as he has worked here for many years and has been preparing these reports for a long time. I would also like to have you attend a business writing class that will assist with your technique. With these tools you will be writing perfect plans in no time!Can I ask how everything else is going for you? Are you having any other personal or professional struggles that are causing stress? I want you to be able to come to me with any roadblocks as I am committed to you and your success here at ABC-5. I look forward to watching you grow! Safe travels! William"
97,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you for you recent contributions identifying improvements for our products and the personal commitment in being on the road so often. We all know how that becomes old pretty quickly. Wanted to discuss with you some feedback I have received regarding your reports. Although they provide great amount of detail we must ensure they are crisp and to the point given the audience we have. There has been great amount of rework to cater them to the our audience and I'd like to ask you to focus on the key issues/actions at hand. Focus on the issue at hand, what is the sense of urgency and outcome. Out HR team has several development courses available to help you cater your message based on your personality style and your audience. Please enroll on them imediately and cater your next report with your learning in mind. Please let me know if I can provide any further coaching and I look forward to read your next report. Regards, William "
39,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing good. I am writing to you to share my feedback on the Beta project reports. Thanks for all your efforts on the reports so far, however you like to share some feedback on the reports so that they can be more direct and to the point. Please keep the following things in mind while you write a report: Keep Facts and opinion separate and only mention the technical information in the report. This would help the reports to be shorter and up to the point. By this I do not mean that we do not appreciate the insights given by you but report is not the right place to give your insights and perceptive. I would also recommend your name to the business writing trainings. This way you would have more command on your language and the reports would be more organised. Feel free to connect with me once once you are available so that I can guide you better. Regards William"
200,"Dear Jonathan, I hope you are well !I am currently writing to you because of some feedback I received from your reports on the Beta project, that the team find a bit too difficult to read and circularize. they are not putting in question your contribution to the project (which I heard was outstanding!) however they feel like this particular area could be improved : they need your reports to be more concise and better organized, so they can be passed on ""as is"" to people external to the project and be understood with minimal reediting. I know you have set high hopes about this project and counting on it to evolve afterwards, therefore I really ask you to take this into account and work on it, that can only weigh more in your favor afterwards !What I can suggest is that first you to get in touch with Terry to understand what level of communication is expected from you. I will also liaise with HR to find out if there is a training in business writing skills available. If not, we'll work on it together : say you send me your this week's report and I'll review it.What do you think about that ?please get back to me once you have talked to Terry. Kind regards, William"
47,"Hi Jonathan, I'm excited that you are so motivated to work on the Beta project and are enjoying gathering the information for your team. We are relying on your information. Before you send your next reports I want you to think about the important facts you will be sending. Choose the most important topics and give us straight forward facts about those specific topics. Remember these report need to be about the topics and not our personal opinions. I know you are gathering an extensive amount of information but we need the most informational and factual. If you have to make a timeline then write your report. I know you can make these next reports outstanding. Please let me know if you need any help or if you want me to proofread. I'm here to help you succeed. ."
129,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing great! Heard you've been travelling quite a lot recently. i am sure you must be enjoying it as you have always been a  travel enthusiast. Writing to you regarding your contribution in the Beta project. Your contribution is highly appreciated and is very critical for the project's success. The insights you bring in are really useful and liked by the managers above. However, it would be great if we could sort out one of the challenges that the team brought out in our recent discussions. Since the project is running on strict deadlines, they would love it if your reports are more concise and bring out facts prominently. Sometimes the team has to spent a lot of time in digging through the reports to find the factual information. I understand that you are super excited with all that is going around in the Beta world, however, try putting those in the additional annexures so that the team can focus on important stuff. Also, I was wondering if you would like to attend some of the business writing training that  we have in our organisation. They will really help you with this and also in enhancing your reports so that the are more impactful. I know this is critical year for you in terms of your career growth and this could really help you go that extra mile. Looking forward with a positive response from your side, I am always open for suggestions. Write back to me in case of anything. William."
177,"Hello Jonathan, I hope your traveling is going well and there are no issues.  Jonathan I am writing to discuss the Beta Project technical reports you have been submitting to Terry.   Overall I want to thank you for all the work you are putting into writing the reports. But please accept these things to consider when turning them in, in the future.  The purpose of the reports are of a technical nature, therefore you should focus on that aspect.  These reports are submitted to perspective customers and the CEO are should just stick to the technical aspects of the Beta project, and should be limited on opinions.  These changes will help you streamline these reports as well as cut down the time that it takes you to produce them. I believe if you stick to the technical aspects of the report it would benefit you in a major way.   Please let me know if there are any issues with the creation of these reports and I will gladly help you with any questions you have.  We really appreciate the work that you have been putting in, but need these reports to be streamlined so that they will be easier to read and more appropriate to present to the CEO. Thank you. And I hope you have a great evening. "
144,"Dear Jonathan, It is really great to see your enthusiasm in work. It is contagious! I hope that others are able to see your insight as well as I do. I have a feedback that the report shared with you are too details and not concise. It is a good thing actually as we really need a lot of information. Please keep those information in separate logbook. However, to let others easily understand to your report, may i ask your help to make the report more concise and keep them in few main points/ bullet points (maximum 6 points)?In turn, you will have faster responds or feedback and the project will progress faster. I really wish that you will keep contributing and be part of the team as i really saw your passion on this project. Kindly approach me if you have any difficulties. Good luck Jonathan! Best Regards, William"
113,"Hi Jonathan, My name is William and I am the manager for your team. I have spoken with your team members and they have said you are passionate about your role at ABC-5 and have good improvement ideas for the team. There are a few areas that I would like you to work on moving forward. When writing your reports, keep it strictly regarding the data and technical information needed. It's difficult to decipher the true content of the report versus your added commentary. There are some educational modules I'd like you to take to help you with business writing. This should help provide you with a foundation to help you move forward in your role and gain confidence and trust among your team and our customers at ABC-5. I'm only available today and then will be away at an assignment for two more weeks. I'd like to set up weekly meetings with you when I return from my assignment. We can go over reports and highlight your strengths and areas of improvements. In the interim, I will have Terry meet with you until I return. As we move forward over the next three months, I expect to see improved business writings and reports that strictly contain data related material. I'm confident your passion for learning and ABC-5 will allow for this learning opportunity to enhance your skills and role. Talk to you soon, William"
182,"Hello Jonathan! I hope all is well with your travels. I have been receiving feedback that you are a great contributor and people enjoy working with you. You have a keen eye for detail and sometimes even identify improvements that weren't even being considered.You are very similar to me with detail. And that is the purpose of you and I having this conversation. Our goal for this program was to have you travel and gather information for technical reports.The technical reports are  given to senior leadership or to our prospective customers and need to be clear and concise. It is has been brought to my attention that your reports,although very detailed, contain too main perspectives and opinions. Due to the audience these reports are being delivered to it is extremely important we separate facts from opinions.I am hoping this message is clear in what I am asking. If this isn't and we need to have a phone conversation I will make sure we can meet as soon as both schedules align.Over the next few months I will ask you to send the technical reports to myself or another member I choose to review the reports. I want to ensure that before this is sent that we are only providing clear, concise information.We can also try and find some classes or online tutorials on business writing. Just like you I had a difficult time being clear and concise. I took a business writing class that helped out. If we need to go down this avenue I will happily supply you information. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!"
109,"Hello Jonathan, I hope that you are doing well and that you are traveling safely. I am currently in the office getting caught up with you a few things, as I have been away for a special assignment. I am reaching out to you to discuss the Beta project and how we are currently supporting the team. In reviewing the updates, it appears there are some opportunities for improvement with the preparation of the technical and business reports. I appreciate you pushing to get these reports done and completed in a timely fashion, but we also need to work to ensure we are meeting the expectations of the team and leadership. At this time we need to improve in the areas of being clear, concise, and accurate in the reports that are provided to the Beta team. I would like for you to take some time and review the following questions and provide feedback tomorrow afternoon:Technical Reports - Am I providing the data and technical information or my opinion?Technical Reports - What is leadership looking for and what do they need to make a decision?Technical Reports - What does good look like? Business Reports - Have a taken time the redline my initial draft?

Let me know your thoughts and we can discuss in more detail in our next meeting. Please let me know in advance if there is anything that you feel needs additional clarification or discussion. Next Steps:Please setup a meeting with me to review current versions of technical and business reports and work on your action plan Please setup a weekly update meeting with me to review future report status and commitments I will work to setup monthly meetings with the team to review best practices for reports and general opportunities for improvement We will work together to review your training to identify opportunities to continue to support your development in this areaI will have one of the team leads provide some initial coaching until I return from the offsite assignment. Thanks, William"
194,"Hello Jonathan, I hope you are travelling well.I am touching base regarding your contributions to the Beta Project. I know between our current priorities, connecting over the phone may be difficult so I just wanted to reach out, hear about your experience with the team and also attend to some feedback received regarding your reporting.The Beta team really appreciate your contributions and suggestions to make improvements, so great work there. The feedback regarding the level of detail in the reports is where the team would like to see some improvements. As you know, these reports are crucial more some senior leaders and customers to make key decisions. It's very important we stick to the facts when sharing these reports. Although additional context and insight may be helpful, sharing these details are probably best left for other forums and conversations. Would you like to send me the next report you work on, so we can have a look through it together and then share it with the Beta team? I'd love to get an understanding of your view on the reporting style, so please let me know when you have time for a call. Thanks, William"
197,"Hi Jonathan, Happy to have you working on the Beta project. You are a good contributor and you identify improvements we did not know we needed. As you know, we face difficult deadlines in this project. Therefore, it is important to have clear reports only containing the key technical information. While we appreciate your findings, it makes the reports difficult to read. Next to this, they have too much detail and are not structured enough. As this is an important part of your objectives and as you are ambitious, we want to help you. As we appreciate your findings, I propose you make a separate report on this.Second, I want to recommend to follow a training on business writing. Please send your next reports to me so I can give you feedback. Are there any other things I can do to help you with this?Thanks, William"
83,"Hello Jonathan, This is regarding your assignment in Beta Project. I hear that you are contribution is well appreciated by the project team. And at the same time, I got some improvement idea for your contribution in the project.The Project team appreciates your valuable inputs as it identified much improvements in the project.There are two thing I would like to request.Keep the report Brief and Concise; No need to put extra commentary which makes the reports redundant and heavyImprove your business writing; Make it on-time, Make sure it is professionalAs you are aware the report is being read by all teammates and clients as well.

Improvement on the above will definitely make it even better. Thanks, William"
67,"Hi Jonathan, How are you doing  lately? The Beta project must be keeping you really busy with the travelling and compiling of the reports. I heard some really good feedback from the team. You have been a good contributor, and you have identified improvements that the tea didn't even realise that they need. Keep up the good work! I also sense that you are really motivated by this project and is looking forward to leveraging this project to gain a promotion to lead engineer. In order for your reports to add value to the project and the teams, I would like to highlight these areas of improvement: Clear and concise report. For reports to be easily and quickly understood, it has to be concise and contain only technical information. We noticed that the reports that you submitted consists of both information and opinions. This results in a much longer report than required. Organisation of the report. Organise the report in a logical and structured manner will help your readers understand what you are trying to say. Consider the amount of details in the report, so that the information that you present is meaningful to the reader.With this in mind, how can you change your reporting layout/structure to make it better for our audiences? At the same time, are there any support or resources that you need from Beata or myself to help you with writing better reports? To be a lead engineer, we will need better business writing skills, on top of the awesome skills that you already have. Let me know your thoughts around this, and I am happy to discuss.  Cheers! William"
36,"Hi Jonathan, Great energy coming form your video message, so great to see your enthusiasm! Let's jump on a call before you begin this next report? I'd like to be close to this one as we are trying to formalise the reporting process across the teams  and i'd love to involve you in this process if you'd be interested?I've heard great things about the information you are collecting, but want to ensure we are aligned on exact information that needs to be included as these are often going to CEO level.Can you send me your latest report so I can take a look and we can go from there? Thanks! William"
46,"Hi Jonathan, Many thanks for your expertise and experience which you have earned with Beta Project. Your report is very informative and it has very detailed information and that reflects your dedication and involvement in project. Appreciate your efforts ! Since this report is reviewed by the CEO, I would recommend you to revisit the same so important message can be given since he has to get right conclusive message and summary in short review. I hope you will be looking into this so it will benefit the Beta project and your conclusions can make it shorter so your recommendations can be considers.. Thanks ! "
70,"Hi Jonathan, I am glad to see you enjoy learning about new technology and travelling. The information that you are collecting and summarizing for the team is very insightful. I have gone through some of your recently shared reports and would like to advice you on some key factors which can further improvise your reports and clearly distinguish your work. Based on my experience, quick suggestions that you may consider to make your reports exclusive are:Include an executive summary in your report - Short & Crisp highlighting key learnings from your experience.Structure the report in a way that categorizes the facts you have gathered and your insights on the facts.In addition to above points, I would like to recommend you to achieve an expertise in Business Writing by taking an online learning course. Since your work will be majorly related to your current profile in coming months, adding an expertise will help you in delivering much more high quality reports and increase your productivity and save time. Saving Time can also give you more time to enjoy your travel.Since your doing an awesome work, I will look forward to recommend you name for level-up in the next performance discussions.. Implementing my suggestions in your work, will help me easily distinguish your work and propose your name to Stephan. I believe you understand my point and will take it positively. If you struggle to find the right course, please let me know. I can recommend some of the boutique courses offered by leading industry veterans on the subject. We can also discuss your learnings once you complete your course."
120,"Jonathan, I am reaching out to discuss your work on the Beta Project while I have been away. I am hearing good feedback from your team on your contribution, thank you for that. I would like to discuss 2 ways which will continue to lead to a positive experience in your contribution. The first is around how to help you efficiently capture your commentary, which in turn will help save you time.  We are all very busy, including yourself so the more concise our commentary, the increased likelihood of our colleagues understanding the information.   The second is helping you create your messages in an cohesive manner, which will help them be easy to read and understand.  This will also help your commentary to be consistent with your colleagues, which will ensure better understanding from customers, as well as internal stakeholders.I would like to partner you up with a tenured employee, Molly, to review how she compiles her commentary in reports.  Upon completion please send over any key learning and how you will incorporate the leanings in your reports. Again thank you for all you do.  I believe by focusing on these two areas you will drive a greater contribution to the team and company. Thanks, William"
15,"Hello Jonathan, I will speak with Terry regarding the reports and make sure he knows what details to include. I am glad that he is finding the Beta project and all its applications to be so interesting and exciting. I will let him know we appreciate the effort he puts in but sometimes it is a little too much when we just need supporting facts for the report. If you are okay with it, I will show him some of your recent reports to coach on how they should be written so he has a better idea of what to include so there is not rework to be had. I would suggest working on the report together so you can discuss the amazing ways that the Beta project can be used so he isn't as inclined to include that in the report. We will discuss his goal of getting promoted to lead engineer and what steps he can take to ensure he gets where he wants. I would like to hear his thoughts on how the Beta project can be utilized across more areas and possibly how to incorporate them. Since he is so enthusiastic about the new technology we may be able to bring him on to work on new applications instead of just the reports. I will let you know how it goes. Please keep me informed of the progress. Thank you!"
55,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are well?It has been brought to my attention that we are having issues with the technical report writing on the Beta Project, which I am hoping you can help correct and resolve? There are two main issues as shown below: Additional Commentary which are opinion based and not necessarily just focused on the facts. This makes the reports very difficult to digest and summarize.Lack of organization which requires additional re-work before being passed onto the CEO or prospective customer. In order to improve this, I will ask Terry to provide you with additional feedback which I am requesting you take on board for the future report writing. There are several reports coming up and if we make these changes now, it will help the team meeting the deadlines moving forward.If you feel like you need additional training on report writing please let me know? Please take this as positive feedback and continue with your enthusiasm on the Beta Project. Kind Regards William"
2,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you are doing well! Thank you for all of you work on the reports. I know that you are very passionate about what you are doing and have embraced this role. I do have some concerns regarding the length of the reports however. These reports you create are a critical piece of this project and I need you to make sure that they are clear and concise with only facts provided in them. I realize that you have gained a tremendous amount of insight from traveling to gather the data, but going forward we need to make sure that only facts are input into this report and not your personal opinions on these matters. The reports need to be well organized, concise and easy to read to insure that the information is interpreted correctly. How can you insure the next set of reports are exactly what we need? What can I do to assist you with your next set of reports as they contain very valuable data? I would like you to generate and compile your reports and send to me for review before sending to the broader team. We can talk about them after I review and make sure they are exactly what is needed. Please let me know what I can do to assist in this process as I truly value the data that is created!"
104,"Hi Jonathan, hope you are good. I am writing to you regarding the Beta project - first of all, thank you for your commitment and hard work on this project, I am happy to see you motivated and excited about this challenging project. I noticed that your reports come with many details and that you also include personal considerations in it. Some feedback from my side, which I think it's important also considering your aspiration to move up to Lead Engineer in the future.Consider *who* you are writing these reports to - the end recipient is the customer or our CEO, and he/she has usually limited amount of time to scroll through and gather as much information as possible, from an objective point of view. If you want to be a Lead Engineer in the future and lead a team, you will be in the very same situationBe concise, precise, and put in only hard-facts statement. Organize it in a clear structure, with bold titles and few, relevant bullet points  with information relevant from a managerial standpoint. Keep in mind the end-recepient of the reports. By doing this, you will"
40,"Hi Jonathan. First of all, thanks for helping out with the Beta project. You have helped us identify improvements that even we didnt know we needed. Now that you have become a seasoned contributor, it is time to up your game. To do that, you can work on 2 major improvement areas of your report for which I have received feedback from your team. The first is that you need to make your reports concise. I understand that you like to provide valuable insights but it becomes difficult to take the main points out of the report. What you can do is that you can keep the insights in an annexure This would keep the core of the report intact and would also enable us to go through your valuable insights.Also though your reports are filled with insights, it is important to also structure them properly so that they can be sent to the management directly without much review. It will only enable you to perform at your peak. I believe if you improve on the above 2 items, you would definitely take your performance to the next level and which would further your career growth in the years to come. I can help you in finding a mentor/ attend training programs to improve your skills. Please feel free to call/ message me for a detailed conversation or if you need my guidance."
115,"Hi Jonathan, Thanks for your help with the Beta project. Your effort in collecting technical data and enthusiasm for the project are well noted and appreciated by the team. I have collected some feedback on your technical reports and identified a few areas for improvement that will help you and the team be more successful and efficient.  While your opinions on the technical details and requirements are appreciated, in the reports we need to focus on the technical requirements that have data to support them. There are two issues with your reporting that need to be resolved immediately or someone else will take over your role on project Beta.1) The reports are rolled up to higher level executives who have limited time and need to see only the technical facts with supporting data.  Please convey your opinions and commentary on the data verbally, in person, not directly in your reports.2) Your technical background is highly regarded but your reports are difficult for higher level executives to quickly digest.  Please ask Terry for an example of one of your previous reports that he has edited and compare it to your original version.  I think you will see the differences and be able to implement the changes yourself in the future.Please let me know that you understand these issues and let me know if you have any questions. Making these improvements to your reports will be critical to your personal and career development at ABC-5. Best regards, William"
135,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are enjoying the travel and all your experiences. The Beta team considers you a good asset that brings them information and improvement opportunities for the project from all over the world.I am reaching out to you to discuss regarding the reports you have been sharing with the team. The team is of high confidence that your information and ideas bring them more opportunities to improve our product, however given the senior management level audience we have for your reports its always best to keep the content precise and factual as it will help them to relate the information and process them better. While you bring such great insights to the team, it only makes sense that this is reaching the senior management who have limited time and will need your ideas reach them crystal clear in most concise form. This will also ensure that your work is directly reaching senior management which gives you more exposure and credibility. This will be a golden opportunity to prove your prowess in providing factual information which are relevant among the vast amount of information you collect and thus help you in a faster career progression. Kindly let me know if you would like to connect with me or if we can help you in any training or courses in written communication and concise analysis. The team would like you to focus on this to ensure the work is done in time, no effort is wasted and there is no double work.Hope you will take my feedback constructively. Best, William"
69,"Hi Jonathan - It sounds like you have been providing technical reports on the Beta project, which has been helpful in identifying improvements and technical findings. I've gotten some feedback that the reports need to be more summarized, so that everyone can focus on the main details on the reports. I think your excitement gathering the information is wonderful, but we need to make sure that you are just providing the specifics of the information. I know that others have been helping to organization, edit, and re-write some of the report before passing it along to prospective customers or internal managers, so I'd like you to take more of a role in making sure your reports are summarized in a way that can really illustrate your findings. I'll attach some good example reports, so please take a look at them and write down questions/ comments, so that when I return,we can discuss any questions you have when I return. You know the information better than anyone, so I want to make sure you are able to express that appropriately in the technical reports. Thanks"
107,"Hi there Jonathan, I hope you're doing well and are staying safe out there on the road! I wanted to touch base with you regarding your efforts on the Beta project. I can tell you that your enthusiasm for the project has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated! Passion for what we're doing makes all the difference, and your passion is clear! That being said, I want to review your contributions to date with the team and offer some insight on how we can perhaps tighten things up a bit; we don't want your messaging to be lost in your overall enthusiasm for the task at hand! 1) You need to be concise; I can tell by what I've reviewed that you have a real passion for the Beta project, and that is fantastic! The only issue is that sometimes the facts of the matter get lost in our own opinions. Less feelings, more facts is my motto!  I'd suggest reviewing your thoughts and feelings about the facts with me in our 1-on-1's and I'm more than happy to listen! 2) Point form is your friend. I would suggest making a draft copy of your findings in point form, and then condensing that even more when you place them in order from most urgent/pressing to least. This will ensure the meatier items aren't left for last, and that the real core of the messaging is properly received. I am confident you will step up to the challenge and embrace the change, just as you have in the past! Adaptability is a very strong asset; it will do you well in your career aspirations! Thank you, William"
123,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you for your message, I am glad to hear that you are finding valuable information on the Beta project that are both factual and applicable to our projects. I know that learning and summarizing all the new information can be overwhelming. I have spoken with some members of the team regarding the reports coming in, and the feedback received is that there is a lot of valuable facts being reported in addition to some application and thoughts you have. Going forward I think it would be best to keep the reports short and concise for quick reference by upper management, and then we can discuss the findings and thoughts on the facts once I am back in the office and at team meetings. If you could please include me in on the next report being sent out I am excited to see the facts that you are finding. I am confident with these changes you will be able to relay the information more effectively going forward. I look forward to speaking with you further on your thoughts for changes and application once I am back. Kind regards."
22,"Jonathan, I'd like to discuss your work on the reports. You've been a great contributor to the team with respect to the reports and have been great in identifying areas for improvements in preparing these reports. You have definitely added value to our process. To ensure that you continue to develop and are on track to achieve your career goals, I'd like to discuss some items that I think can help in your development. with respect to the reports.As you know, the technical reports are used to help make some very critical decisions at ABC-5. As such, it is very important that the reports be concise and only include data relevant to the decision-making. When the reports include other data, it prolongs the decision-making process, which makes it difficult for us to meet our deadlines. Your comments within the reports are very insightful and thought-provoking - we appreciate you taking the time to include them. However, going forward, I ask that you please save your comments in a file outside the report.Also, going forward, we will have a template of the report. This will help in ensuring that the reports are more concise and include on the information relevant. Please follow the templates on all future reports.We will discuss your first report that has these changes implemented so we can ensure that you're comfortable with your reports and we're on the same page with the format. I'd also love to discuss your comments after the reports have been submitted and our deadline has been met. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any of the changes and/or any questions/concerns you may have."
158,"Jonathan, I appreciate your enthusiasm and hard work you are putting into the Beta Project. I do hate you are being overwhelmed and it concerns me. To help reduce the pressure I would like you to divide your report into 3 categories. The first category is the basic facts. Secondly, a deeper explanation of the basic facts with additional details. Lastly, your opinion of the facts and details. Breaking it down like this will help you from getting overwhelmed while at the same time making it easier for the team to read.Once again thank you for work on the Beta Project and if you any questions on my request of the new reporting structure contact me."
186,"Hi Jonathan, How have you been doing?  It has been a long time since we last connected. I do understand that you are working with the team on Beta which I do hear good feedback on how you have value-added with improvements onto the Beta project.  While your peers are working closely with you, there are areas whereby we can help you to improve and these will in turn assist you in your career growth.  I do share your enthusiasm in working on projects in Beta and do let me assist you to provide you with some suggestions.It will be great to prepare your reports with the main points clearly mentioned along with facts so that it will be easier for all team members to better understand what is required for them.  You may want to have your opinions voiced under a comment / note so that team members can understand why this is required and how important it is to further explain. The reports will need to be concise so that external parties like our customers will be reading them and it will be important that they can understand the reports.  This is to help the team better manage the time in view of the project time frame while we can spend more time to improve the Beta project. You may wish to attend some courses on business writing and if you have concerns over business writing, you can look for myself or Stephan for assistance to improve your business writing for the upcoming reports. Do let me know what you need help with and I am an email away from you. Regards, William"
9,"Jonathan, Hello! I hope my e mail finds you doing well! I wanted to reach out to you in regard to your work on the Beta project. It is clear that you are excited about this opportunity to be a part of this team and that is great! I do want to provide you some feedback on your work to date to make sure you are on track and working to your full potential to support the group. It is important to remember that this is a fact finding mission. It is important to keep in mind the audience that will inevitably end up reading these reports- high level executives with limited time. It is important to be clear, concise and factual with these reports, which will allow less editing by the rest of the team before final submital. Although I appreciate your passion for the project, it is critical to separate fact from opinion to be successful in this role. Perhaps you could submit your next report directly to me first for review prior to submittal to the rest of the team so I can help ensure you are on track. Also, when you have some free time, give me a call and tell me all the exciting things you are learning with this new project and we can discuss how you can use your performance on this team to leverage this experience for future projects. I'm looking forward to reading your new approach on your next report! Thanks in advance and I look forward to hearing from you! William"
49,"Hi Jonathan, I hope your offsite research for the Beta project is going on as per plan. I just wanted to drop a quick note regarding some feedback inputs I received regarding your contribution to the project. I hear from some team members that most of your reports are pretty elaborate and a lot of time is spent in editing and make it relevant to the end user. While I understand that you are a stickler to good quality research, I also want you to understand that senior stakeholders usually lack the patience and have less time to read through extensive content. It would help you make a better impact as a team member if you are able to give just the top insights of your research in a concise manner. I have spoken to  … , and she has offered to mentor you personally and help you write brief reports. Please schedule some time with her and review of some of your reports before you send it across to Terry. Do write back to me or Karen if you feel that this feedback is incorrect and you have a difference of opinion. Best regards, William"
87,"Jonathan, I am glad to hear that you are enjoying your work on the Beta project. Based on feed back on past reports, I need to make some suggestions forthis next report and future reports. It is important that you realize thepurpose of your report and theimportance of getting the key informationexplained. Length of the reportdoes not increase it's value. For you next report, please make some changes in your process. I suggest making an outline of key points that showcase the important ideas you are trying to communicate. Your enthusiasm is great but will be better shown by organizing the technical points that need to be shared. Your insights and opinions should not be part of a fact sheet about the project. Pleaseemail meyour next report so we may discuss the format as moving forward the reports need to follow a more concise format. Of course, this means that you will need to work on this next report quickly so that you will be able to submit it to Terry on time. I appreciate your contribution to the Beta project and look forward to seeing that report."
4,"Hello Jonathan, Hope you are well!while i would have loved to catch up with you on call, Since you are travelling, I am writing this email to you to discuss a feedback that i have for you. I understand that you are working on the Beta project and have been able to come up with some interesting findings.   Given the anount of research, time and dedication you are putting in, in getting the study together - it is important that we are able to utilize the same as well for implementing recommendations based on your insights. I have received feedback that your report can be structured bettter and be more focused on the findings. To ensure that your report is creating the right impact, i feel that it will help if you can do a survey / take feedback from your stakeholders on the report structure and related aspects like length, language, exhibits, fact representation etc. This will help customize your work to what your stakeholders really need and help you in the process! What do you think about this suggestion? Also, when you are back and i m also back from my project work, let us connect and discuss on your development needs. Rgds, William"
160,"Hi Jonathan, I wanted to reach out to you regarding some feedback I received thus far on the Beta project.  First of all, your team really values your insights on the production and enjoys your engagement in the process. While the reports to date have been thorough the report needs more organization so that the team can quickly ascertain the facts that needs as they include this information to upper management.  One particular area of concern is that main points or facts are often hard to decipher amongst your own commentary or opinions.  Also some of the wording you are choosing is not as professional as other examples we have seen. To assist you with this process, I want to provide the attached template that we have used in previous reports. In reviewing this reporting, I hope that you can follow the structure going forward and see how your insights can still be included by at the end of the document in a footnote or appendix. To assist with the adding a more organized and professional tone to your writing, I also want to send you to an online training course that should be able to help you streamline your thought process and provide clearer and more concise reporting. If time allows, going forward I would suggest that you send your reports to your counterpoints to provide commentary prior to final submission. I think these tools will help you to excel in this role and provide more value to your team.  I encourage you to seek their feedback directly as you look to improve and this is critically important to your success within the team. I am confident that this experience will be invaluable in your future roles with the company and again we appreciate your efforts on our behalf."
124,"Hello Jonathan Thank you for your contribution to the team and I am pleased to know how passionate you are towards the job. I understand that you are working on the Beta project and we indeed garner lots of useful information from you. Because of you, we even identifies improvements we didn't know we needed. However, Jonathan, we have deadlines to submit our reports. We do appreciate the information you gathered by it is sometimes too much for the team to digest within the short period of time. We do hoped that the report we received from you can be more technical not much on your perspectives. We would like to see the main focus on the report. I suggest that you put your own perspectives in another documents than the report itself. I have heard that you are interested in the promotion to a lead engineer. However, as a lead engineer, you ought to improve your business writing. The technical information are indeed beneficial to the project but these reports are shown to the high-ranking managers. I have noticed that some of the reports are late from the team and this does not place a good impression on this team. Hence, it is important to write a clear and concise report. I believe that you team are able to guide you how to write a good report or you can look at the past written report. All in all, Jonathan, we can see the effort you have put in the project but do understand that there are more one elements that make the project success.  In the near future, I would like to see you provide me with the plans for your improvement. Of course, we will not want to miss your extra efforts but do write them in another report than the technical reports. I do hope to see the Beta Project Team strive to success with your help Jonathan. "
119,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're fine.As i know you are working on collecting reports for the project and therefor providing a very critical task to the project i want to get in touch with you to discuss some points and also offer you my advice, as i know this is something that is new for you. Whenever you finallize your reports, always keep in mind to adress the target group. We are talking here about our top management looking into those reports, so keep the information clear and simple and to the point. Also be as dispassionate as possible, as these reports are a collection of data. Personal recommendations i would recommend to discuss personally with Terry as the project lead. As i'm away please get in personal contact with Terry. He is the project lead and very experienced with those reports. Go pro-actively to him and ask him for his guidance an writing those reports. In the end this is in your advantage and you have the possibility to dicuss you opinions on several facts.This is a fantastic chance for you get visibility and deliver important information for the success of the project. Please send me the next report on CC, so i can provide you further ideas if needed."
164,"Hi Jonathan, I'm very pleased about your enthusiasm towards your new role and the Beta project.  Like any new role, this is an opportunity to build on your skillset.  Your technical expertise and teamwork skills have been highlighted but your reports have been flagged as requiring improvement.  This is an opportunity for you to further develop your business writing skills.  If you need any support on strengthening this skill or for feedback please contact me."
188,"Hi Jonathan, I would have liked to meet you in person or spoken directly since I was back in office for a day, but this will probably do for the moment. I can see that you have been quite involved with the Beta project and been contributing to a great extent with your reports. There is some feedback that I have received and would like to discuss the same with you.The reports that you have submitted seem to have a mix of facts, surrounding details and your opinions put together in a slightly disarrayed manner. This would mean that the reports become unnecessarily lengthy and probably difficult to grasp. Your reports are very critical to the project and it is important that we keep these reports to the point and completely fact-based, to save the group's time and effort to decipher the report. I hope you understand the important role that you have to continue playing and to ensure your reports serve their purpose to the greatest extent. To support you in this endeavour to more concise report writing, I shall request Mary to share some writing tips with you. Given her experience in writing technical documents, she will definitely be of great help.Let's get working towards this goal and meet up when I back from my assignment in a couple of weeks. Wish you all the best! Regards, William"
50,"Good Afternoon Jonathan hope all is well ? Great work on the Beta project your work is very much appreciated and valued.I have been getting updates from Terry and we have identified a few things that may be able to help with your continued development.What i would like you to do is start writing your reports containing only facts and if the project requires additional opinions we can discuss them as required. This will ensure we get the main points immediately and help instantly use the data. Your opinion is highly valued but for the report it needs to be factual and displayed clear and concise. The work you have currently provided is excellent however the information could be in a easier format so what i would like you to do is attend ABC-5's report writing course which is fantastic and will aid your development and give you some great ideas. If you could e-mail Beata in HR they will get you booked on.Your work is vital and extremely important and i look forward to seeing the improvements you can make to the reports, if you could let me know when your course is booked and also please send your next report to me and we can review together before you submit into Terry.If you would like to discuss this further please do not hesitate to get in contact. Thanks William"
27,"Hi Jonathan, I hope this message finds you well during your travels. I have heard you have been enjoying the Beta project and that you are a good contributor to the team and that is great news. However i would just like to discuss a few areas on concern with you for this particular project. Terry has informed me that although you have identified some great improvements your reports are unfortunately too long with too much of commentary and the team cant really separate fact from your opinion. He says he did mention this to you before but it was not taken seriously. I see the passion in your work we just need to focus and streamline it a bit more so that you can deliver a report that is correct and eveyone can understand.I think first things first is to get you enrolled into a training program for businee/report writing to help you get the technical knowledge. i also would like to assign you a mentor that has great experience with report writing that can help you when you need it. We can also have regular check-ins to see how the progress is being made.I know with your travels it might be easeir to do the training online so maybe in the meantime start doing some research on this. Also i would really like to hear your feedback on this. You are a great associate and we all learn new skills daily as part of our development."
179,"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're keeping well on your current business travels. I have just caught up with Terry with regards to the Beta project and was hoping to discuss some feedback with you. Please do let me know when you have read the below so we can discuss further. Terry has mentioned that you are a great contributor to the team and that you have fit in well, also mentioning that you are being innovative by mentioning improvements that the team hadn't considered. This  is great to hear - keep up the good work! Terry and I also discussed the reports that a being generated and it was mentioned that they are proving quite time consuming. Have you considered reviewing the content of these to ensure only the information that is required is being documented? It's great to see how excited you are about learning during this project. However, we need to consider the information that is included in the reports and consider the audience in that they are intended for. As the reports are for our customers or Exec board, I would like you to consider what factual information they require and the purpose of sharing this information. As these reports are required for critical decision making, we require the reports to be fact based and concise to ensure relevant information is readily available. If it would help, I can share some examples of this? Furthermore, we can enquire about a training in this area if you feel you would be of benefit to this? Your insight is extremely valuable to us so let's understand how we can best share this information with the wider team, separate to the reports that are being to ensure that they are used for the intended purpose of providing insight. Let's work together on the next few reports in the meantime before sharing with the project team. Finally, is there anything I can help you with? Do you have any feedback to share or require support in any other areas? Kind regards, William"
30,"Hi Jonathan, I trust that you are doing well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding your current project Beta. I have heard some good feedback about you on how good you are on collecting technical information and come up with new improvement ideas. Its good to see your dedication. Keep it up. However, along with this, there are few areas of improvement that have been identified for you.There have been concerns raise on your report building and presentation skills. These are one of the important skills to grow in your career. Thus, I have suggested to put you on these skill building programs. I see lot of potential in you and would want you to succeed and climb the corporate ladder. I am sure you will consider this and start working on issues. I will suggest you have direct conversation with Terry and his team to have open feedback. Good Luck. Once you are back lets connect and discuss further..."
93,"Hi Jonathan, Hope you are doing good! Understand that you are quite happy with the Beta Project and gaining a lot of experience out of it. This is really an exciting opportunity for you.Keeping in mind the opportunity comes a bit of responsibility also. Considering the reports that you are sending, it's really good to know that you are giving enough insights in form of commentary along with the technical information. You have done a really good job as far as technical information is concerned, on the other hand one should have an understanding about what exactly the reader of the report wants. In this case they would only want to see the technical information rather than along with your perspectives on the report. Suggest you to concentrate on the technical findings only as this will result in less time spend for the end user to search for the facts and thus will meet the deadlines which I believe has been a struggle in the recent past. I suggest you to just have a quick 10 mins call with me just before submitting the report so that we are on the same page and figure out if the facts are clearly visible.Since you are gaining on experience, I would suggest you to undergo trainings on business writing. By doing so you will understand how to convey your message in a short and crisp way. This will not only save time for yourself and your counter part but will also help you to communicate exactly what you want to.I will suggest your name for the upcoming training and you can participate to change for the better.This is in line with the feedback I received as they are quite happy with the technical facts still there are some areas of improvement. Best Regards, William"
137,"Hello Jonathan, How are you? Hop everythingg is going well form your side. Unfortunately We didn't have to much time to discuss together in last period as both of us travelling a lot. Well, I had the opportunity to review of your technical report which was very impressive interms of techinal information contained, however, ascorporate we need, to be morealigned in the format. We need to include all relevant technical information butat he same time we need to propose in a clear, professional and concise form.I am planning to send a report from my end that you can consider as a reference and feel free to share your draft next time in order to me to highlight improvement opportunity in your report style. Please keep working hard as you are doing and looking toget receive your report to further discuss about. "
58,"Jonathan- GLAD THAT YOU LIKE THE JOB YOU DO , KEEP UP THE SPIRIT BUT HERE ARE CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS.1) Appreciate your insights on the project - but the reports needs to be concise. You can send your views & insights separate that will be looked into as feedback for improvement 2) Take training in business writing to improve the report writing.Set a deadline to make this improvement & report back We appreciate your good work , but improve on these observations"
37,"Hey Jonathan, How's it going? I know I have been unavailable a lot lately because of my special assignment. I had some ""free time"" today so I thought I would get in touch with you. I hear you are doing great on that Beta project you are involved in. I am glad you are giving it your all. One thing though to help the rest of the team out would be to get the reports organized and more concise. I haven't seen the reports directly myself, but if you need any help with the reports let me know. It is really important that you take the effort to change how you are writing these reports. To help me get an idea of what is going on can you send me some of reports you have written recently. I will look them over and give feedback on changes I would make and why I would make them. We need to work on this together before you send out your next report. I know this is an extra step you are going to have to take but I want to help as much with this so the Beta project is successful.  Thanks, William."
112,"Jonathan, I appreciate your work on the Beta project.  I know it requires a lot of your time and travel and it is appreciated.  Something I need to address with you though.  Some reports are being turned in late and it is impacting decisions being made.  I'd like for you to work on creating more concise reports to pertain only to the business at hand.  I would like for you to work with Terry to get tips from him on how to write a clear report.  Also, I would like for you to send your reports to me as well for my review.  Please limit your reports to data based findings.  Jonathan your reports are very important to the overall success of this project and I am counting on you to improve in this area.  Please work with Terry on your next 4 reports to create that clear, concise report that is needed.  If we do not see improvement in this area, I will assign someone else to the work on this project."
79,"Hi Jonathan, As you are travelling and I am on a tight deadline today, I wanted to address some points with you that have come to my attention.  We can have a call at some future point, however it's in everybody's best interest that I bring these to your attention sooner rather than later. Your job is critical to the Beta Project, as you know, and the information you provide is crucial to the success of the project. The issue is with your report writing, and specifically, the format and lack of clarity in some of the reports.  You are really a great contributor, but you are undoing a lot of your good work by adding too much detail, without a lot of structure, and adding opinion, which is not solicited. Remember, the facts are what we need and presented in a manner that allows quick processing of the information and decision making on the part of the person reading the report.I would recommend that you form. Apologies that I cannot speak to you directly at present, we should catch up at some point in the future if you have any follow-up questions."
170,"Hi Jonathan, How are you doing? I heard you are supporting Terry in his Beta project. He is super positive about the insights you bring to the table. However, there are couple of suggestions from my side in view of the team and their deadlines.Team likes the way you contribute and bring additional information which they are not aware. But, at the same time they are not able to meet deadlines due to your expressive and exciting thoughts. I request you to be more concise about your insights.Business writing looks to be your area of improvement. As you focus lot of time on developing more data and insights, you might be losing time on improving Business writing. I know you have not been taught how to prepare the reports. It is also partly my mistake as I kept you encouraging about strengths and not focusing your improvement areas.Here is what i have in store for you. I am committing myself to personally teach you Business writing in addition to making you to go through the e-learning programs on the same. Similarly, I need a commitment from you to adhere to the deadlines and reduce the expressive thoughts and be precise in your insights generation.Sometimes, too many insights also will make the solution more difficult and delay in execution. You provide which are your best 2-3 options/insights for the execution and use the other time to focus on business writing. It will be a win-win for both of us.This will also ensure your are not only technically knowledgeable but also good in writing which will help you to move up the career.Once I am back, let's see the progress. I will ask Terry to coordinate with you for e-learning courses to get assigned to you."
18,"Hi Jonathan, Checking in to see how things are going on the Beta project. How are you enjoying working on the team?I'd like to highlight some areas of concerns where I think you can better support the team. You have a vast amount of knowledge that seems to be getting lost in the details of your reports.I have observed many of the reports have great details, but the facts are be overshadowed by opinion.  I'd like for you to frame your arguments more concisely by presenting the facts and including a brief recommendation based on the findings. Approaching the work this way will ensure your work packages have maximum effect. Please send me a reply back with any questions/concerns, and confirm you are committed to driving this change. I'd also like to review your next report before it is submitted to the team so I can provide more concrete feedback.As always, please feel free to raise any concerns you have.Thanks! William"
178,"Good afternoon, Jonathan. I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss the reports you provide to Terry's team. We appreciate the hard work and effort you're putting into the reports. However, the feedback I've received is that Terry and his team are having to do extra work to get the data they need from your reports. This extra effort is delaying their own report submissions.I'm going to set up meeting with you to go over the how to modify your report so it can meet the needs of Terry's team. We will also have a follow up meeting with Terry to make sure the change in report format works for them. From their feedback, it is clear that your enthusiasm and attention to detail are giving them information on items they hadn't even considered. I don't want to lose that kind of effort and data so I'll find out if there's a better audience/format for the additional insight you develop. Let me know if you have any questions and thanks for your hard work."
175,"Hi Jonathan, I heard from Terry that you are are investing the great effort and delivering very good results on your current assignement even managing to identify some new potential improvements fititng well on the market. What I would like to ask you to help with is structuring your regular report in 2 sections:requested report as per template agreed with Terry. This will make his life much easier combining with the rest of the content he should provide to the higher managers and ensure we are collecting all necessary info in the expected format. We have to provide info in the structered expected format so even the colleagues not so familiar with the project will be capable understanding it easily.second section should contain all additional info you are to provide, obesarvitions, ideas and additional analysis we should fruther disscus on the project level.This way we will insure that we are finializing expeccted work in the mot efficient way while we are not missing valuable info we have managed to collect.It looks that you are a bit overloaded and stressed, do you need some help/support maybe? Please feel free to contact me any time. All the best, William."
90,"Hi Jonathan, I just want to touch base about your involvement with the Beta project.  I hope you're enjoying and getting a lot out of this exciting experience.  I understand you've been a valuable part of this project.I've received some feedback about how we can improve your contribution to the project,  specifically as it relates to your reports.  I appreciate you may not have a lot of experience writing these types of reports, so I'm hoping you'll take this feedback to heart and recognize that this might be an area of improvement for you and that making improvements here can be important to your development within the company. Specifically, try to keep in mind what the readers of these reports are looking for.  I believe the report-readers will benefit from clear, concise, and fact-driven reports.  While I'm sure your own personal perspectives are insightful, they are not really the purpose of these reports, and they may be creating more work for the individuals that are tasked with editing your reports.  When considering the reader of these reports, also consider the organization of your reports and how to communicate your findings and data most efficiently to a reader.  It is important these reports are clear, concise, and well-organized.I'd be happy to work with you on your report-writing or to team you up with a colleague who has experience; this way I'm hoping you can turn this into one of your strengths.  Let's check in on this issue next time I have a day away from my project. Thanks, William"
149,"Hello Jonathan, Hope you're doing great. I heard about your extensive travel and collecting great information for the work, I appreciate it very much. I hope you're liking it ! As you may have known by now in your current role you have a huge opportunity for learning and growth. Given that your experience in business writing is less, you developed of self interest in the report writing and you are doing a good job. In the series of this I also noticed that there are couple of areas where you can improve yourself. While you write the reports lets keep the content precise and clear. The reports that you create are presented to the stakeholders and CEO. It reflects the quality of work you do, I have no doubt in the good work that you do but while putting your knowledge or information gained, in writing you should ensure that the reader is able to differentiate the importance of information. I'm always up to offer any help you would require in learning, I assure you this would one of the critical components which will you help you ladder up. I would like to see the improvement right from your next report, I can make arrangements to bump up your timelines so there isn't any risk of missing a deadline. Let me know if you would like help to develop a revised timeline. Let me know if you have any concerns. Best regards, William"
63,"Morning Jonathan, Thanks for your effort towards the Beta project. I have had the opportunity to review some of  your most recent reports as well as your video and wanted to provide some feedback. In your videos please be mindful of the audience of the information and while it's good to be personable, limit your commentary and focus more on the facts. I would also like for you to partner with our Learning and Development team for additional support on Written Communications. Please partner with them by the end of the week, include your Manager on updates weekly. I agree that this is a great opportunity for you and would like to get a commitment from you that you will support improving these opportunities to ensure it's a successful journey. After partnering with your Manager and L/D please send me a recap of your plan to improve and bi-weekly update of the progress. Thanks for your efforts, William "
155,"Hi Jonathan, I trust that you are doing good and enjoying all the travelling.Well, I have reviewed the report reports that you have been sharing all this while and have also discussed with Terry about the usability of the same. Couple of things that I wanted to shared with you are mentioned below, unfortunately since we could not connect personally I am listing them down. It is great that you have so much information about so many products but it would be better if you limit the size of the report. From reader's perspective it becomes really overwhelming to read so much and derive a useful conclusion out of it. You can keep noting down your observations in another document and probably after this project we can circulate it to relevant stakeholders!I saw your message, and i could see that you are quite eager to explore new opportunities and collect as much information as possible. Would just suggest that for now you only focus on doing your work best possible way, promotion and payhike will come to you eventually basis your performance.I would also like to understand in case you are facing any issue in incorporating above feedbacks, so that we as team can work towards making these reports more  useful for Terry and his team.Let us work together towards this endeavor.Thanks, William"
68,"Hi Jonathan, I will need you to revise your finding on the report attached. Please provide facts on the subjects that its being discuss, most of time you're providing your opinoin. Eventhough, we care for your opinion the report needs to be based on facts. Also, re-read your work prior to submission to me.

169,"Hey Jonathan, Hope all is well.I have hear that youve been very busy traveling, learning and making a lot of reports, thats wonderful, I have personally spoken with Terry about these reports and understand that they are too detailed, which in some cases is good but in others it may not be so good.I would like to give you some recommendations about them. How you know our focus and in our DNA we have continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. I consider it essential that you have a meeting with Terry so that he can explain what he needs and so it may be that what you send is very good but for him it is not functional. We could be falling into overworking or making unnecessary efforts.I want to propose the following: 1. Make a meeting with Terry so that he can explain his needs, what exactly is expected of you2. Focus on customer needs3. Document what was agreed at the meeting and share it with CC to Terry.With these simple steps I am 100% sure that your work will be even more appreciated, in addition to that it will give me tools to help you to continue developing and well one step close to achieve the goal you have of being Lead engineer.Appreciate your actions and efforts. Regards, William"
180,"Hi Jonathan, I understand you've been contributing to Beta project reporting, and I want to thank you for that. However, it appears your approach should be refined because your current reporting is not meeting our needs. We need to provide clear, concise, fact-based reporting every time, and at this point the team has found you resistant to changing your format to reflect this need. Others on the team have spent significant time editing your reporting to our standards, and they cannot continue to do so. I suggest you review the prior reporting and adapt your style to meet the needs of our team, i.e. we need only well organized facts that can easily be understood by our audience (remember, you're writing to the audience's needs, not your own). You're welcome to include more commentary in an email to me and the team, because we do appreciate a lot of your insights, but we do not have room for it within the report. If you cannot commit to this change now, we will recommend removing you from the project. Thank you. William"
122,"Hello Jonathan, I am writing in regards to the technical reports that you submit using the information you are collecting.  Your reports are extremely detailed and provide all of the data needed to make decisions, and your insights and conclusions are well thought out.  However, as these are technical reports, it is always a good idea to separate the facts and data from personal conclusions, to allow others to draw their own conclusions from the information provided.  From what I've heard, there is a lot to be gained from your experience and first hand knowledge.  I would suggest that you include your comments and ideas in a separate appendix to your report.  This would allow reviewers to gain the main points of the report, but also allow them the opportunity review your conclusions on the data.  Also, providing a more concise report allows others to draw their own conclusions, and they are then able to contact you, personally, if they would like more information on the subject. I know that business writing can be a daunting task, and we've all had to learn ways to get our thoughts down in a way that is both professional and easily understood.  I know I have!  If you would like, we can enroll you in some courses in writing, or I'd be happy to review your reports before submission.  Just let me know. Thank you for your continued contributions! William"
10,"Hi Jonathan, Thank you very much for your hard work in the Beta project. I believe you have a lot of learning and discoveries during your journey. I also read your report and received an email from Terry. He recognized your efforts and enthusiasm very much, and thanked you for finding many problems that need improvement. I also very much approve of your report, which is full of content, but I wonder if I can have some quick feedback on the report format? Maybe we can improve in this regard:1. More neutral;2. More professional business writing;In order to work together more effectively, I would suggest that Terry participate in our discussion together, hoping to contribute to the project more effectively based on your original foundation, I believe you also recognize this."
42,"Hi Jonathan, In speaking with Terry, he told me that you have been a good contributor to the the Beta Team and have identified improvements that we didn't know we needed. Great job on being a team player! While I love the enthusiasm you bring to the team, we definitely need to stick to the facts in our reports and leave our own perspectives out. Terry mentioned that the reports have too much commentary and are too lengthy. I want you to work on only providing the technical information from here on. I also gave Terry a book on business writing that I want you to read. It can really help you grow and develop in your career! I know you are looking to move up the ladder so expanding your business writing skills now will be key. On your next report focus on being organized and concise, providing only the technical information. I will have Terry follow up with me on your development in two weeks."
48,"Good morning Jonathan, I would like to discuss with you a couple of things that I have noticed in your reports lately. While we appreciate the extra information that you are providing in the reports, I would like you to keep them on topic and concise. If there are other ideas you would like to share with the team or information that you feel may be beneficial to the team, please advise me via email or we can schedule a meeting to review that information. I am glad you are excited about being on the team, I am also glad you are on the team. Please let me know if these are things you will be able to implement when it comes time for your to submit your next report. Is there anything you need from me? Thank you in advance for your cooperation and commitment to the team.  Thank you, William"
76,"Hi Jonathan, how are you? I hope everything is well on your side. I wish to talk to you in person however since you travelling it is best to send you this mail. I received a feedback from Terry that you are helping him on the Beta project. I was told that you have really good inputs however, he is quite concerns on some on the way you provide the reports. We can discuss in more details but for now I would like you to talk to Terry when you have the chance to fully understand the improvement that you need to do to better provide concise and quality reporting. I am pretty sure we can work this out as long as you lay down your commitment to improve those issues mentioned. If needed, we can provide you with some formal training to aid you.  "
