In this task, you will be analyzing a piece of feedback given to an employee to determine whether it demonstrates empathy, perspective taking, and encouragement. Finally, you will classify the feedback either as `{class1}` or `{class2}`.

Here is the target feedback to analyze:

<target_feedback>
{target_text}
</target_feedback>

Here are the example responses:
<examples>
-------------------
<example1>
{example1}
</example1>
-------------------
<example2>
{example2}
</example2>
-------------------
<example3>
{example3}
</example3>
-------------------
</examples>

Please read the target feedback carefully, paying attention to the language used, the flow of the feedback, and the tone.

Then, in a <reasoning></reasoning> section, go through the target feedback sentence by sentence and analyze why this target feedback is either as `{class1}` OR `{class2}`.

Note any specific word choices or phrases that make the target feedback either as `{class1}` OR `{class2}`. Also comment on how the sentences flow together and the overall tone.

After you've analyzed each sentence, write a final <analysis></analysis> section that summarizes why this target feedback is an example of an `{class1}` OR `{class2}`, based on your reasoning.

Finally, provide your classification decision in <classification></classification> section.
