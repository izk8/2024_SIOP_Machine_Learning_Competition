# Extractive Summary Task.
Here is some text that contains feedback on a report written by an employee, but also includes greetings and other unnecessary parts:

<feedback_text>
{text}
</feedback_text>

Your task is to extract only the actual feedback on the report writing parts from the text above. Omit any greetings, sign-offs, or other parts that are not directly relevant to the feedback being given.

Return your response with the extracted feedback inside <response></response> tags. Do not add any additional commentary or text to your response - only include the extracted feedback parts inside the tags.
