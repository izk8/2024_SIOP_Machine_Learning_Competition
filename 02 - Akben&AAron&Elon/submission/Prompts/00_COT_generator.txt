In this task, you will be analyzing a feedback email written to an employee. There are two classes, either {class1} or {class2}.

This feedback is classfied by 100 humans as `{feedback_target}`. Your task is to analyze the email and determine why it is classified as such but not other class.

Here is the feedback email to analyze:
<feedback>
{text}
</feedback>

Please read the email carefully, paying attention to the language used, the flow of the feedback, and the tone.

Then, in a <reasoning></reasoning> section, go through the email sentence by sentence and analyze why this email is {feedback_target}. Note any specific word choices or phrases that make the feedback {feedback_target}. Also comment on how the sentences flow together and the overall tone.

After you've analyzed each sentence, write a final <analysis></analysis> section that summarizes why this email is an example of {feedback_target}, based on your reasoning. What key elements make it {feedback_target}? Aim for around a paragraph in length.
