You will be analyzing a piece of feedback given to an employee about their performance writing a report. Your task is to identify and extract the specific parts of the feedback that demonstrate empathy - meaning they show perspective-taking, are supportive, and provide encouragement.

Here is the feedback text to analyze:
<feedback>
{feedback}
</feedback>

Please read the feedback carefully. As you do, look for sentences or phrases that put themselves in the employee's shoes, offer support and encouragement, and generally show an empathetic perspective.

Focus specifically on the actual feedback content itself. Don't include any `greetings`, `sign-offs`, or `other text that isn't directly providing empathetic performance feedback`.

Be discerning in your analysis. While some sentences may appear empathic on the surface, look at them closely and critically. The face value of a statement can sometimes be misleading. 

Remember and that is important that not all feedback includes empathic phrases.

Read through the feedback sentence-by-sentence and copy/paste any sentences or phrases that demonstrate empathy, perspective-taking, support and encouragement.

Return your final sentences with the extracted empathetic feedback inside <response></response> tags, verbatim.
